    "text": "Unlike R, Julia does not immediately expose a huge number of functions, but instead requires loading packages (whether from the standard library or from the broader package ecosystem) for a lot of relevant functionality for statistical analysis. There are technical reasons for this, but one further motivation is that Julia is at a broader “technical computing” audience (like MATLAB or perhaps Python) and less at a “statistical analysis” audience.\nThis has two important implications:\nThis notebook is not intended to be an exhaustive list of packages, but rather to highlight a few packages that I suspect will be particularly useful. Before getting onto the packages, I have one final hint: take advantage of how easy and first-class package management in Julia is. Having good package management makes reproducible analyses much easier and avoids breaking old analyses when you start a new one. Pluto helpfully installs and manages for you, but the package-manager REPL mode (activated by typing ] at the julia&gt; prompt) is very useful."

(Confusingly, the function for reading and writing Arrow format files in R is called read_feather and write_feather, but the modern Arrow format is distinct from the older Feather format provided by the feather package.) This is the format that we store the example and test datasets in for MixedModels.jl.\nCSV.jl useful for reading comma-separated values, tab-separated values and basically everything handled by the read.csv and read.table family of functions in R.\n\nNote that by default both Arrow.jl and CSV.jl do not return a DataFrame, but rather “column tables” – named tuples of column vectors."

    "text": "1.2 DataFrames\nUnlike in R, DataFrames are not part of the base language, nor the standard library.\nDataFrames.jl provides the basic infrastructure around DataFrames, as well as its own mini language for doing the split-apply-combine approach that underlies R’s dplyr and much of the tidyverse. The DataFrames.jl documentation is the place to for looking at how to e.g. read in a CSV or Arrow file as a DataFrame. Note that DataFrames.jl by default depends on CategoricalArrays.jl to handle the equivalent of factor in the R world, but there is an alternative package for factor-like array type in Julia, PooledArrays.jl. PooledArrays are simpler, but more limited than CategoricalArrays and we (Phillip and Doug) sometimes use them in our examples and simulations.\nDataFrame.jl’s mini language can be a bit daunting, if you’re used to manipulations in the style of base R or the tidyverse. For that, there are several options; recently, we’e had particularly nice experiences with DataFrameMacros.jl and Chain.jl for a convenient syntax to connect or “pipe” together successive operations. It’s your choice whether and which of these add-ons you want to use! Phillip tends to write his code using raw DataFrames.jl, but Doug really enjoys DataFrameMacros.jl."

Well, that’s because formulas are essentially their own domain-specific language (a variant of Wilkinson-Roger notation) and macros are used for manipulating the language itself – or in this case, handling an entirely new, embedded language! This is also why macros are used by packages like Turing.jl and Soss.jl that define a language for Bayesian probabilistic programming like PyMC3 or Stan."

StandardizedPredictors.jl provides functions for centering, scaling, and z-scoring within the formula.

Their reaction time was measured each day, starting the day before the first night of sleep deprivation, when the subjects were on their regular sleep schedule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis description is inaccurate.

The parameter estimates are about 250 ms. typical reaction time without deprivation and a typical increase of 10.5 ms. per day of sleep deprivation.\nThe random effects represent shifts from the typical behavior for each subject. The shift in the intercept has a standard deviation of about 24 ms. which would suggest a range of about 200 ms. to 300 ms. in the intercepts. Similarly within-subject slopes would be expected to have a range of about 0 ms./day up to 20 ms./day.\nThe random effects for the slope and for the intercept are allowed to be correlated within subject. The estimated correlation, 0.08, is small. This estimate is not shown in the default display above but is shown in the output from VarCorr (variance components and correlations).\n\nVarCorr(m1)\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nVariance\nStd.Dev\nCorr.\n\n\n\n\nsubj\n(Intercept)\n565.51067\n23.78047\n\n\n\n\ndays\n32.68212\n5.71683\n+0.08\n\n\nResidual\n\n654.94145\n25.59182\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnically, the random effects for each subject are unobserved random variables and are not “parameters” in the model per se. Hence we do not report standard errors or confidence intervals for these deviations. However, we can produce prediction intervals on the random effects for each subject. Because the experimental design is balanced, these intervals will have the same width for all subjects.\nA plot of the prediction intervals versus the level of the grouping factor (subj, in this case) is sometimes called a caterpillar plot because it can look like a fuzzy caterpillar if there are many levels of the grouping factor.

For example, in m2 there are two fixed-effects parameters and three variance components (including the residual variance).\nAn alternative, more geometrically inspired definition of “degrees of freedom”, is the sum of the leverage values, called geomdof in this table.\nInterestingly, the model with fewer parameters, m2, has a greater sum of the leverage values than the model with more parameters, m1. We’re not sure what to make of that.\nIn both cases the sum of the leverage values is toward the upper end of the range of possible values, which is the rank of the fixed-effects model matrix (2) up to the rank of the fixed-effects plus the random effects model matrix (2 + 36 = 38).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI think that the upper bound may be 36, not 38, because the two columns of X lie in the column span of Z\n\n\nThis comparison does show, however, that a simple count of the parameters in a mixed-effects model can underestimate, sometimes drastically, the model complexity. This is because a single variance component or multiple components can add many dimensions to the linear predictor.\n\n\n4 Some diagnostic plots\nIn mixed-effects models the linear predictor expression incorporates fixed-effects parameters, which summarize trends for the population or certain well-defined subpopulations, and random effects which represent deviations associated with the experimental units or observational units - individual subjects, in this case. The random effects are modeled as unobserved random variables.\nThe conditional means of these random variables, sometimes called the BLUPs or Best Linear Unbiased Predictors, are not simply the least squares estimates. They are attenuated or shrunk towards zero to reflect the fact that the individuals are assumed to come from a population. A shrinkage plot, Figure 3, shows the BLUPs from the model fit compared to the values without any shrinkage. If the BLUPs are similar to the unshrunk values then the more complicated model accounting for individual differences is supported. If the BLUPs are strongly shrunk towards zero then the additional complexity in the model to account for individual differences is not providing sufficient increase in fidelity to the data to warrant inclusion.\n\n\nCode\nshrinkageplot!(Figure(; resolution=(500, 500)), m1)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Shrinkage plot of means of the random effects in model m1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis plot could be drawn as shrinkageplot(m1). The reason for explicitly creating a Figure to be modified by shrinkageplot! is to control the resolution.\n\n\nThis plot shows an intermediate pattern. The random effects are somewhat shrunk toward the origin, a model simplification trend, but not completely shrunk - indicating that fidelity to the data is enhanced with these additional coefficients in the linear predictor.\nIf the shrinkage were primarily in one direction - for example, if the arrows from the unshrunk values to the shrunk values were mostly in the vertical direction - then we would get an indication that we could drop the random effect for slope and revert to a simpler model. This is not the case here.\nAs would be expected, the unshrunk values that are further from the origin tend to be shrunk more toward the origin. That is, the arrows that originate furthest from the origin are longer. However, that is not always the case. The arrow in the upper right corner, from S337, is relatively short. Examination of the panel for S337 in the data plot shows a strong linear trend, even though both the intercept and the slope are unusually large. The neighboring panels in the data plot, S330 and S331, have more variability around the least squares line and are subject to a greater amount of shrinkage in the model. (They correspond to the two arrows on the right hand side of the figure around -5 on the vertical scale.)\n\n\n5 Assessing variability by bootstrapping\nThe speed of fitting linear mixed-effects models using MixedModels.jl allows for using simulation-based approaches to inference instead of relying on approximate standard errors. A parametric bootstrap sample for model m is a collection of models of the same form as m fit to data values simulated from m.

If there is no matching row in the second table then missing values are inserted for the columns from the right table in the result.\n\ndescribe(\n  leftjoin!(\n    ldttrial,\n    select(byitem, :item, :wrdlen, :isword);\n    on=:item,\n  ),\n)\n\n8×7 DataFrame\n\n\n\nRow\nvariable\nmean\nmin\nmedian\nmax\nnmissing\neltype\n\n\n\nSymbol\nUnion…\nAny\nUnion…\nAny\nInt64\nType\n\n\n\n\n1\nsubj\n409.31\n1\n409.0\n816\n0\nInt16\n\n\n2\nseq\n1687.21\n1\n1687.0\n3374\n0\nInt16\n\n\n3\nacc\n0.85604\nfalse\n1.0\ntrue\n1370\nUnion{Missing, Bool}\n\n\n4\nrt\n846.325\n-16160\n732.0\n32061\n0\nInt16\n\n\n5\nitem\n\nAarod\n\nzuss\n0\nString\n\n\n6\ns2\n0.407128\nfalse\n0.0\ntrue\n0\nBool\n\n\n7\nwrdlen\n7.99835\n1\n8.0\n21\n0\nUnion{Missing, Int8}\n\n\n8\nisword\n0.499995\nfalse\n0.0\ntrue\n0\nUnion{Missing, Bool}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the wrdlen and isword variables in this table allow for missing values, because they are derived from the second argument, but there are no missing values for these variables.

It would not be meaningful to plot the raw data because that would just provide horizontal lines at \\(\\pm 1\\). Instead we add the smoother to show the trend and omit the raw data points.\nThe resulting plot, Figure 2, shows the accuracy of identifying words is more-or-less constant at around 84%, but accuracy decreases with increasing word length for the nonwords.\n\n\nCode\ndraw(\n  data(@subset(ldttrial, !ismissing(:acc))) *\n  mapping(\n    :wrdlen =&gt; \"Word length\",\n    :acc =&gt; \"Accuracy\";\n    color=:isword,\n  ) * smooth(; span=0.75, degree=2, npoints=200);\n  figure=(; resolution=(800, 450)),\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Smoothed curves of accuracy versus word length in the lexical decision task.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 may be a bit misleading because the largest discrepancies in proportion of accurate identifications of words and nonwords occur for the longest words, of which there are few.

The area of the marker is proportional to the number of observations represented.\n\n\n\n\nThe pattern in the range of word lengths with non-negligible counts (there are points in the plot down to word lengths of 1 and up to word lengths of 21 but these points are very small) is that the accuracy for words is nearly constant at about 84% and the accuracy fof nonwords is slightly higher until lengths of 13, at which point it falls off a bit.\n\n\n1.2.2 Summaries by subject\nA summary of accuracy and median response time by subject\n\nbysubj = @chain ldttrial begin\n  groupby(:subj)\n  @combine(\n    :ns = length(:acc),               # no. of obs\n    :smiss = count(ismissing, :acc),  # no. of missing acc\n    :sacc = count(skipmissing(:acc)), # no. of accurate\n    :smedianrt = median(:rt),\n  )\n  @transform!(:spropacc = :sacc / :ns)\nend\n\n814×6 DataFrame789 rows omitted\n\n\n\nRow\nsubj\nns\nsmiss\nsacc\nsmedianrt\nspropacc\n\n\n\nInt16\nInt64\nInt64\nInt64\nFloat64\nFloat64\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\n3374\n0\n3158\n554.0\n0.935981\n\n\n2\n2\n3372\n1\n3031\n960.0\n0.898873\n\n\n3\n3\n3372\n3\n3006\n813.0\n0.891459\n\n\n4\n4\n3374\n1\n3062\n619.0\n0.907528\n\n\n5\n5\n3374\n0\n2574\n677.0\n0.762893\n\n\n6\n6\n3374\n0\n2927\n855.0\n0.867516\n\n\n7\n7\n3374\n4\n2877\n918.5\n0.852697\n\n\n8\n8\n3372\n1\n2731\n1310.0\n0.809905\n\n\n9\n9\n3374\n13\n2669\n657.0\n0.791049\n\n\n10\n10\n3374\n0\n2722\n757.0\n0.806758\n\n\n11\n11\n3374\n0\n2894\n632.0\n0.857736\n\n\n12\n12\n3374\n4\n2979\n692.0\n0.882928\n\n\n13\n13\n3374\n2\n2980\n1114.0\n0.883225\n\n\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n\n\n803\n805\n3374\n5\n2881\n534.0\n0.853883\n\n\n804\n806\n3374\n1\n3097\n841.5\n0.917902\n\n\n805\n807\n3374\n3\n2994\n704.0\n0.887374\n\n\n806\n808\n3374\n2\n2751\n630.5\n0.815353\n\n\n807\n809\n3372\n4\n2603\n627.0\n0.771945\n\n\n808\n810\n3374\n1\n3242\n603.5\n0.960877\n\n\n809\n811\n3374\n2\n2861\n827.0\n0.847955\n\n\n810\n812\n3372\n6\n3012\n471.0\n0.893238\n\n\n811\n813\n3372\n4\n2932\n823.0\n0.869514\n\n\n812\n814\n3374\n1\n3070\n773.0\n0.909899\n\n\n813\n815\n3374\n1\n3024\n602.0\n0.896266\n\n\n814\n816\n3374\n0\n2950\n733.0\n0.874333\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshows some anomalies\n\ndescribe(bysubj)\n\n6×7 DataFrame\n\n\n\nRow\nvariable\nmean\nmin\nmedian\nmax\nnmissing\neltype\n\n\n\nSymbol\nFloat64\nReal\nFloat64\nReal\nInt64\nDataType\n\n\n\n\n1\nsubj\n409.311\n1\n409.5\n816\n0\nInt16\n\n\n2\nns\n3373.41\n3370\n3374.0\n3374\n0\nInt64\n\n\n3\nsmiss\n1.68305\n0\n1.0\n22\n0\nInt64\n\n\n4\nsacc\n2886.33\n1727\n2928.0\n3286\n0\nInt64\n\n\n5\nsmedianrt\n760.992\n205.0\n735.0\n1804.0\n0\nFloat64\n\n\n6\nspropacc\n0.855613\n0.511855\n0.868031\n0.973918\n0\nFloat64\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, some subjects are accurate on only about half of their trials, which is the proportion that would be expected from random guessing. A plot of the median response time versus proportion accurate, Figure 5, shows that the subjects with lower accuracy are some of the fastest responders, further indicating that these subjects are sacrificing accuracy for speed.\n\n\nCode\ndraw(\n  data(bysubj) *\n  mapping(\n    :spropacc =&gt; \"Proportion accurate\",\n    :smedianrt =&gt; \"Median response time (ms)\",\n  ) *\n  (visual(Scatter) + smooth())\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Median response time versus proportion accurate by subject in the LDT.\n\n\n\n\nAs described in Balota et al. (2007), the participants performed the trials in blocks of 250 followed by a short break. During the break they were given feedback concerning accuracy and response latency in the previous block of trials. If the accuracy was less than 80% the participant was encouraged to improve their accuracy. Similarly, if the mean response latency was greater than 1000 ms, the participant was encouraged to decrease their response time. During the trials immediate feedback was given if the response was incorrect.\nNevertheless, approximately 15% of the subjects were unable to maintain 80% accuracy on their trials\n\ncount(&lt;(0.8), bysubj.spropacc) / nrow(bysubj)\n\n0.15233415233415235\n\n\nand there is some association of faster response times with low accuracy. The majority of the subjects whose median response time is less than 500 ms. are accurate on less than 75% of their trials. Another way of characterizing the relationship is that none of the subjects with 90% accuracy or greater had a median response time less than 500 ms.\n\nminimum(@subset(bysubj, :spropacc &gt; 0.9).smedianrt)\n\n505.0\n\n\nIt is common in analyses of response latency in a lexical discrimination task to consider only the latencies on correct identifications and to trim outliers. In Balota et al. (2007) a two-stage outlier removal strategy was used; first removing responses less than 200 ms or greater than 3000 ms then removing responses more than three standard deviations from the participant’s mean response.\nAs described in Section 1.2.3 we will analyze these data on a speed scale (the inverse of response time) using only the first-stage outlier removal of response latencies less than 200 ms or greater than 3000 ms. On the speed scale the limits are 0.333 per second up to 5 per second.\nTo examine the effects of the fast but inaccurate responders we will fit models to the data from all the participants and to the data from the 85% of participants who maintained an overall accuracy of 80% or greater.\n\npruned = @chain ldttrial begin\n  @subset(!ismissing(:acc), 200 ≤ :rt ≤ 3000,)\n  leftjoin!(select(bysubj, :subj, :spropacc); on=:subj)\n  dropmissing!\nend\nsize(pruned)\n\n(2714311, 9)\n\n\n\ndescribe(pruned)\n\n9×7 DataFrame\n\n\n\nRow\nvariable\nmean\nmin\nmedian\nmax\nnmissing\neltype\n\n\n\nSymbol\nUnion…\nAny\nUnion…\nAny\nInt64\nDataType\n\n\n\n\n1\nsubj\n409.802\n1\n410.0\n816\n0\nInt16\n\n\n2\nseq\n1684.56\n1\n1684.0\n3374\n0\nInt16\n\n\n3\nacc\n0.859884\nfalse\n1.0\ntrue\n0\nBool\n\n\n4\nrt\n838.712\n200\n733.0\n3000\n0\nInt16\n\n\n5\nitem\n\nAarod\n\nzuss\n0\nString\n\n\n6\ns2\n0.40663\nfalse\n0.0\ntrue\n0\nBool\n\n\n7\nwrdlen\n7.99244\n1\n8.0\n21\n0\nInt8\n\n\n8\nisword\n0.500126\nfalse\n1.0\ntrue\n0\nBool\n\n\n9\nspropacc\n0.857169\n0.511855\n0.869295\n0.973918\n0\nFloat64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Choice of response scale\nAs we have indicated, generally the response times are analyzed for the correct identifications only. Furthermore, unrealistically large or small response times are eliminated. For this example we only use the responses between 200 and 3000 ms.\nA density plot of the pruned response times, Figure 6, shows they are skewed to the right.\n\n\nCode\ndraw(\n  data(pruned) *\n  mapping(:rt =&gt; \"Response time (ms.) for correct responses\") *\n  AlgebraOfGraphics.density();\n  figure=(; resolution=(800, 450)),\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Kernel density plot of the pruned response times (ms.) in the LDT.\n\n\n\n\nIn such cases it is common to transform the response to a scale such as the logarithm of the response time or to the speed of the response, which is the inverse of the response time.\nThe density of the response speed, in responses per second, is shown in Figure 7.\n\n\nCode\ndraw(\n  data(pruned) *\n  mapping(\n    :rt =&gt; (x -&gt; 1000 / x) =&gt; \"Response speed (s⁻¹) for correct responses\") *\n  AlgebraOfGraphics.density();\n  figure=(; resolution=(800, 450)),\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Kernel density plot of the pruned response speed in the LDT.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6 and Figure 7 indicate that it may be more reasonable to establish a lower bound of 1/3 second (333 ms) on the response latency, corresponding to an upper bound of 3 per second on the response speed. However, only about one half of one percent of the correct responses have latencies in the range of 200 ms. to 333 ms.\n\ncount(\n  r -&gt; !ismissing(r.acc) && 200 &lt; r.rt &lt; 333,\n  eachrow(ldttrial),\n) / count(!ismissing, ldttrial.acc)\n\n0.005867195806137328\n\n\nso the exact position of the lower cut-off point on the response latencies is unlikely to be very important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing inline transformations vs defining new columns\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you examine the code for (fit-elpldtspeeddens?), you will see that the conversion from rt to speed is done inline rather than creating and storing a new variable in the DataFrame.\nI prefer to keep the DataFrame simple with the integer variables (e.g. :rt) if possible.\nI recommend using the StandardizedPredictors.jl capabilities to center numeric variables or convert to zscores.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Transformation of response and the form of the model\nAs noted in Box & Cox (1964), a transformation of the response that produces a more Gaussian distribution often will also produce a simpler model structure. For example, Figure 8 shows the smoothed relationship between word length and response time for words and non-words separately,\n\n\nCode\ndraw(\n  data(pruned) *\n  mapping(\n    :wrdlen =&gt; \"Word length\",\n    :rt =&gt; \"Response time (ms)\";\n    :color =&gt; :isword,\n  ) * smooth()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Scatterplot smooths of response time versus word length in the LDT.\n\n\n\n\nand Figure 9 shows the similar relationships for speed\n\n\nCode\ndraw(\n  data(pruned) *\n  mapping(\n    :wrdlen =&gt; \"Word length\",\n    :rt =&gt; (x -&gt; 1000/x) =&gt; \"Speed of response (s⁻¹)\";\n    :color =&gt; :isword,\n  ) * smooth()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Scatterplot smooths of response speed versus word length in the LDT.\n\n\n\n\nFor the most part the smoother lines in Figure 9 are reasonably straight. The small amount of curvature is associated with short word lengths, say less than 4 characters, of which there are comparatively few in the study.\nFigure 10 shows a “violin plot” - the empirical density of the response speed by word length separately for words and nonwords. The lines on the plot are fit by linear regression.\n\n\nCode\nlet\n  plt = data(@subset(pruned, :wrdlen &gt; 3, :wrdlen &lt; 14))\n  plt *= mapping(\n    :wrdlen =&gt; \"Word length\",\n    :rt =&gt; (x -&gt; 1000/x) =&gt; \"Speed of response (s⁻¹)\",\n    color=:isword,\n    side=:isword,\n  )\n  plt *= (visual(Violin) + linear(; interval=:confidence))\n  draw(plt, axis=(; limits=(nothing, (0.0, 2.8))))\nend\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Empirical density of response speed versus word length by word/non-word status, with lines fit by linear regression to each group."

    "text": "1.3 Models with scalar random effects\nA major purpose of the English Lexicon Project is to characterize the items (words or nonwords) according to the observed accuracy of identification and to response latency, taking into account subject-to-subject variability, and to relate these to lexical characteristics of the items.\nIn Balota et al. (2007) the item response latency is characterized by the average response latency from the correct trials after outlier removal.\nMixed-effects models allow us greater flexibility and, we hope, precision in characterizing the items by controlling for subject-to-subject variability and for item characteristics such as word/nonword and item length.\nWe begin with a model that has scalar random effects for item and for subject and incorporates fixed-effects for word/nonword and for item length and for the interaction of these terms.\n\n1.3.1 Establish the contrasts\nBecause there are a large number of items in the data set it is important to assign a Grouping() contrast to item (and, less importantly, to subj). For the isword factor we will use an EffectsCoding contrast with the base level as false. The non-words are assigned -1 in this contrast and the words are assigned +1. The wrdlen covariate is on its original scale but centered at 8 characters.\nThus the (Intercept) coefficient is the predicted speed of response for a typical subject and typical item (without regard to word/non-word status) of 8 characters.\nSet these contrasts\n\ncontrasts = Dict(\n  :subj =&gt;

    "text": "Kliegl et al. (2015) is a follow-up to Kliegl et al. (2010) (see also script mmt_kwdyz11.qmd) from an experiment looking at a variety of effects of visual cueing under four different cue-target relations (CTRs). In this experiment two rectangles are displayed (1) in horizontal orientation , (2) in vertical orientation, (3) in left diagonal orientation, or in (4) right diagonal orientation relative to a central fixation point. Subjects react to the onset of a small or a large visual target occuring at one of the four ends of the two rectangles. The target is cued validly on 70% of trials by a brief flash of the corner of the rectangle at which it appears; it is cued invalidly at the three other locations 10% of the trials each. This implies a latent imbalance in design that is not visiable in the repeated-measures ANOVA, but we will show its effect in the random-effect structure and conditional modes.\nThere are a couple of differences between the first and this follow-up experiment, rendering it more a conceptual than a direct replication. First, the original experiment was carried out at Peking University and this follow-up at Potsdam University. Second, diagonal orientations of rectangles and large target sizes were not part of the design of Kliegl et al. (2010). To keep matters somewhat simpler and comparable we ignore them in this script.\nWe specify three contrasts for the four-level factor CTR that are derived from spatial, object-based, and attractor-like features of attention. They map onto sequential differences between appropriately ordered factor levels. Replicating Kliegl et al. (2010), the attraction effect was not significant as a fixed effect, but yielded a highly reliable variance component (VC; i.e., reliable individual differences in positive and negative attraction effects cancel the fixed effect). Moreover, these individual differences in the attraction effect were negatively correlated with those in the spatial effect.\nThis comparison is of interest because a few years after the publication of Kliegl et al. (2010), the theoretically critical correlation parameter (CP) between the spatial effect and the attraction effect was determined as the source of a non-singular LMM in that paper. The present study served the purpose to estimate this parameter with a larger sample and a wider variety of experimental conditions. Therefore, the code in this script is largely the same as the one in kwdyz.jl.\nThere will be another vignette modelling the additional experimental manipulations of target size and orientation of cue rectangle. This analysis was reported in the parsimonious mixed-model paper (Bates et al., 2015); they were also used in a paper of GAMMs (Baayen et al., 2017). Data and R scripts are also available in R-package RePsychLing. Here we provide some of the corresponding analyses with MixedModels.jl and a much wider variety of visualizations of LMM results."

Moreover, credibility intervals are shorter for the first spatial effect sod than the other two effects, because the spatial effect involves the valid condition which yielded three times as many trials than the other three conditions. Consequently, the spatial effect is more reliable. Unfortunately, due to differences in scaling of the x-axis of the panels this effect must be inferred. One option to reveal this difference is to reparameterize the LMM such model parameters estimate the conditional modes for the levels of condition rather than the contrast-based effects.

    "text": "3.2 Extract a stratified subsample\nFor the prupose of the tutorial, we extract a random sample of 1000 boys and 1000 girls. Child, School, and Cohort are grouping variables. Traditionally, they are called random factors because the units (levels) of the factor are assumed to be a random sample from the population of their units (levels).\nCohort has only nine “groups” and could have been included as a set of polynomical fixed-effect contrasts rather than a random factor. This choice warrants a short excursion: The secular trends are very different for different tests and require the inclusion of interaction terms with Test contrasts (see Figure 4 in (Fühner et al., 2021). The authors opted to absorb these effects in cohort-related variance components for the Test contrasts and plan to address the details of secular changes in a separate analysis.\nFor complex designs, when they are in the theoretical focus of an article, factors and covariates should be specified as part of the fixed effects. If they are not in the theoretical focus, but serve as statistical control variables, they could be put in the RES - if supported by the data.\nStratified sampling: We generate a Child table with information about children. MersenneTwister(42) specifies 42 as the seed for the random number generator to ensure reproducibility of the stratification. For a different pattern of results choose, for example, 84. We randomly sample 1000 boys and 1000 girls from this table; they are stored in samp. Then, we extract the corresponding subset of these children’s test scores from df and store them dat.\n\nChild = unique(select(df, :Cohort, :School, :Child, :Sex, :age))\nsample = let\n  rng = MersenneTwister(42)\n  combine(\n    groupby(Child, :Sex), x -&gt; x[rand(rng, 1:nrow(x), 1000), :]\n  )\nend\ninsamp(x) = x ∈ sample.Child\ndat = @subset(df, insamp(:Child))\n\n9663×8 DataFrame9638 rows omitted\n\n\n\nRow\nTest\nCohort\nSchool\nChild\nSex\nage\na1\nzScore\n\n\n\nCat…\nString\nString\nString\nCat…\nFloat64\nFloat64\nFloat64\n\n\n\n\n1\nSpeed\n2013\nS101540\nC002482\nGirls\n7.99452\n-0.505476\n0.0551481\n\n\n2\nPowerUP\n2013\nS101540\nC002482\nGirls\n7.99452\n-0.505476\n-0.342524\n\n\n3\nPowerLOW\n2013\nS101540\nC002482\nGirls\n7.99452\n-0.505476\n0.74162\n\n\n4\nCoordination\n2013\nS101540\nC002482\nGirls\n7.99452\n-0.505476\n-0.209186\n\n\n5\nEndurance\n2013\nS101540\nC002482\nGirls\n7.99452\n-0.505476\n-0.127938\n\n\n6\nSpeed\n2013\nS102090\nC002513\nGirls\n7.99452\n-0.505476\n-0.422921\n\n\n7\nPowerUP\n2013\nS102090\nC002513\nGirls\n7.99452\n-0.505476\n-0.762963\n\n\n8\nPowerLOW\n2013\nS102090\nC002513\nGirls\n7.99452\n-0.505476\n-0.188712\n\n\n9\nCoordination\n2013\nS102090\nC002513\nGirls\n7.99452\n-0.505476\n0.81382\n\n\n10\nEndurance\n2013\nS102090\nC002513\nGirls\n7.99452\n-0.505476\n0.452557\n\n\n11\nSpeed\n2013\nS103299\nC002621\nGirls\n7.99452\n-0.505476\n0.859704\n\n\n12\nPowerUP\n2013\nS103299\nC002621\nGirls\n7.99452\n-0.505476\n0.218061\n\n\n13\nPowerLOW\n2013\nS103299\nC002621\nGirls\n7.99452\n-0.505476\n0.74162\n\n\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n\n\n9652\nCoordination\n2018\nS111508\nC117805\nGirls\n9.10609\n0.606092\n-0.95589\n\n\n9653\nEndurance\n2018\nS111508\nC117805\nGirls\n9.10609\n0.606092\n-1.67367\n\n\n9654\nSpeed\n2018\nS111648\nC117827\nBoys\n9.10609\n0.606092\n0.859704\n\n\n9655\nPowerUP\n2018\nS111648\nC117827\nBoys\n9.10609\n0.606092\n0.6385\n\n\n9656\nPowerLOW\n2018\nS111648\nC117827\nBoys\n9.10609\n0.606092\n0.483194\n\n\n9657\nCoordination\n2018\nS111648\nC117827\nBoys\n9.10609\n0.606092\n0.708474\n\n\n9658\nEndurance\n2018\nS111648\nC117827\nBoys\n9.10609\n0.606092\n-0.337186\n\n\n9659\nSpeed\n2018\nS112197\nC117868\nBoys\n9.10609\n0.606092\n0.578748\n\n\n9660\nPowerUP\n2018\nS112197\nC117868\nBoys\n9.10609\n0.606092\n0.498354\n\n\n9661\nPowerLOW\n2018\nS112197\nC117868\nBoys\n9.10609\n0.606092\n-0.550508\n\n\n9662\nCoordination\n2018\nS112197\nC117868\nBoys\n9.10609\n0.606092\n0.538978\n\n\n9663\nEndurance\n2018\nS112197\nC117868\nBoys\n9.10609\n0.606092\n0.938553\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to missing scores for some tests we have about 2% less than 10,000 observtions."

(2021). In summary:\n\nMain effects of age and Sex: There are developmental gains in the ninth year of life; boys outperform girls. There is no main effect of Test because of z-scoring.\nInteractions of Test and age: Tests differ in how much children improve during the year (i.e., the magnitude of developmental gain), that is slopes depend on Test.\nInteractions of Test and Sex: The sex difference is test dependent, that is the difference between the slopes depends on Test.\nThe most distinctive result is the absence of evidence for an age x Sex x Test interaction, that is the slopes for boys and girls are statistically parallel for each of the five tests.\n\n\n\nCode\nlet\n  design1 = mapping(:age, :zScore; color=:Sex, col=:Test)\n  lines1 = design1 * linear()\n  means1 = design1 * visual(Scatter; markersize=5)\n  draw(data(df2) * means1 + data(df) * lines1;)\nend\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Age trends by sex for each Test for the full data set\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows performance differences for the full set of data between 8.0 and 9.2 years by sex in the five physical fitness tests presented as z-transformed data computed separately for each test.\n\nEndurance = cardiorespiratory endurance (i.e., 6-min-run test),\nCoordination = star-run test,\nSpeed = 20-m linear sprint test,\nPowerLOW = power of lower limbs (i.e., standing long jump test),\nPowerUP = power of upper limbs (i.e., ball push test),\nSD = standard deviation. Points are binned observed child means; lines are simple regression fits to the observations.\n\nWhat do the results look like for the stratified subsample? Here the parallelism is much less clear. In the final LMM we test whether the two regression lines in each of the five panels are statistically parallel for this subset of data. That is, we test the interaction of Sex and age as nested within the levels of Test. Most people want to know the signficance of these five Sex x age interactions.\nThe theoretical focus of the article, however, is on comparisons between tests displayed next to each other. We ask whether the degree of parallelism is statistically the same for Endurance and Coordination (H1), Coordination and Speed (H2), Speed and PowerLOW (H3), and PowerLow and PowerUP (H4). Hypotheses H1 to H4 require Sequential Difference contrasts c1 to c4 for Test; they are tested as fixed effects for`H1 x age x Sex, H2 x age x Sex, H3 x age x Sex, and H4 x age x Sex.\n\n\nCode\ndat2 = combine(\n  groupby(\n    select(dat, :, :age =&gt; ByRow(x -&gt; round(x; digits=1)) =&gt; :age),\n    [:Sex, :Test, :age],\n  ),\n  :zScore =&gt; mean =&gt; :zScore,\n  :zScore =&gt; length =&gt; :n,\n)\n\n\n120×5 DataFrame95 rows omitted\n\n\n\nRow\nSex\nTest\nage\nzScore\nn\n\n\n\nCat…\nCat…\nFloat64\nFloat64\nInt64\n\n\n\n\n1\nGirls\nSpeed\n8.0\n-0.323114\n28\n\n\n2\nGirls\nPowerUP\n8.0\n-0.590476\n26\n\n\n3\nGirls\nPowerLOW\n8.0\n0.0677992\n27\n\n\n4\nGirls\nCoordination\n8.0\n0.0273318\n25\n\n\n5\nGirls\nEndurance\n8.0\n-0.17337\n26\n\n\n6\nBoys\nSpeed\n8.0\n0.394634\n19\n\n\n7\nBoys\nPowerUP\n8.0\n0.328703\n19\n\n\n8\nBoys\nPowerLOW\n8.0\n0.105077\n19\n\n\n9\nBoys\nCoordination\n8.0\n-0.170018\n19\n\n\n10\nBoys\nEndurance\n8.0\n0.407084\n19\n\n\n11\nGirls\nSpeed\n8.1\n-0.205934\n54\n\n\n12\nGirls\nPowerUP\n8.1\n-0.653961\n54\n\n\n13\nGirls\nPowerLOW\n8.1\n-0.157127\n54\n\n\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n\n\n109\nGirls\nCoordination\n9.0\n-0.000188842\n68\n\n\n110\nGirls\nEndurance\n9.0\n-0.234448\n68\n\n\n111\nGirls\nSpeed\n9.1\n-0.285047\n25\n\n\n112\nGirls\nPowerUP\n9.1\n-0.112684\n25\n\n\n113\nGirls\nPowerLOW\n9.1\n-0.117645\n24\n\n\n114\nGirls\nCoordination\n9.1\n-0.127844\n25\n\n\n115\nGirls\nEndurance\n9.1\n-0.587496\n24\n\n\n116\nBoys\nSpeed\n9.1\n0.379808\n17\n\n\n117\nBoys\nPowerUP\n9.1\n0.523085\n17\n\n\n118\nBoys\nPowerLOW\n9.1\n0.294696\n17\n\n\n119\nBoys\nCoordination\n9.1\n0.209309\n16\n\n\n120\nBoys\nEndurance\n9.1\n0.266512\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlet\n  design2 = mapping(:age, :zScore; color=:Sex, col=:Test)\n  lines2 = design2 * linear()\n  means2 = design2 * visual(Scatter; markersize=5)\n  draw(data(dat2) * means2 + data(dat) * lines2;)\nend\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Age trends by sex for each Test for the stratified sample\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 Performance differences for subset of data between 8.0 and 9.2 years by sex in the five physical fitness tests presented as z-transformed data computed separately for each test.\n\nEndurance = cardiorespiratory endurance (i.e., 6-min-run test),\nCoordination = star-run test,\nSpeed = 20-m linear sprint test,\nPowerLOW = power of lower limbs (i.e., standing long jump test),\nPowerUP = power of upper limbs (i.e., ball push test),\nSD = standard deviation.

    "text": "3.4 SeqDiffCoding of Test\nSeqDiffCoding was used in the publication. This specification tests pairwise differences between the five neighboring levels of Test, that is:\n\nH1: Star_r - Run (2-1)\nH2: S20_r - Star_r (3-2)\nH3: SLJ - S20_r (4-3)\nH4: BPT - SLJ (5-4)\n\nThe levels were sorted such that these contrasts map onto four a priori hypotheses; in other words, they are theoretically motivated pairwise comparisons. The motivation also encompasses theoretically motivated interactions with Sex. The order of levels can also be explicitly specified during contrast construction. This is very useful if levels are in a different order in the dataframe.\nNote that random factors Child, School, and Cohort are declared as Grouping variables. Technically, this specification is required for variables with a very large number of levels (e.g., 100K+ children). We recommend the explicit specification for all random factors as a general coding style.\nThe first command recodes names indicating the physical fitness components used in the above figures and tables back to the shorter actual test names. This reduces clutter in LMM outputs.\n\nrecode!(\n  dat.Test,\n  \"Endurance\" =&gt; \"Run\",\n  \"Coordination\" =&gt; \"Star_r\",\n  \"Speed\" =&gt; \"S20_r\",\n  \"PowerLOW\" =&gt; \"SLJ\",\n  \"PowerUP\" =&gt; \"BMT\",\n)\ncontrasts = merge(\n  Dict(nm =&gt; SeqDiffCoding() for nm in (:Test, :Sex)),\n  Dict(nm =&gt; Grouping() for nm in (:Child, :School, :Cohort)),\n);\n\nThe statistical disadvantage of SeqDiffCoding is that the contrasts are not orthogonal, that is the contrasts are correlated. This is obvious from the fact that levels 2, 3, and 4 are all used in two contrasts. One consequence of this is that correlation parameters estimated between neighboring contrasts (e.g., 2-1 and 3-2) are difficult to interpret. Usually, they will be negative because assuming some practical limitations on the overall range (e.g., between levels 1 and 3), a small “2-1” effect “correlates” negatively with a larger “3-2” effect for mathematical reasons.\nObviously, the tradeoff between theoretical motivation and statistical purity is something that must be considered carefully when planning the analysis.\nVarious options for contrast coding are the topic of the MixedModelsTutorial_contrasts_emotikon.jl and MixedModelsTutorial_contrasts_kwdyz.jl notebooks."

In general, smaller deviance, AIC, and BIC indicate an improvement in goodness of fit. Usually, χ² should be larger than the associated degrees of freedom; for AIC and BIC the decrease should amount to more than 5, according to some literature. Severity of meeting these criteria increases from deviance to AIC to BIC. Therefore, it is not always the case that the criteria are unanimous in their verdict. Basicly, the more confirmatory the analysis, the more one may go with deviance and AIC; for exploratory analyses the BIC is probably a better guide.

For main effects of age and Sex, z-values decrease strongly with the complexity of the model (i.e., standard errors are larger). For other coefficients, the changes are not very large and not consistent.\nIn general, dropping significant variance components and/or correlation parameters may lead to anti-conservative estimates of fixed effects (e.g., Schielzeth & Forstmeier, 2008). Basically, some of the variance allocated to age and Sex in LMM m_ovi could also be due to differences between schools. This ambiguity increased the uncertainty of the respective fixed effects in the other two LMMs."

    "text": "4.8 Effects in RES\nFor every random factor, MixedModels.PCA() extracts as many PCs as there are VCs. Therefore, the cumulation of variance across PCs within a random factor will always add up to 100% – at the latest with the last VC, but, in the case of overparameterized LMMs, the ceiling will be reached earlier. The final PCs are usually quite small.\nPCs are extracted in the order of the amount of unique variance they account for. The first PC accounts for the largest and the final PC for the least amount of variance. The number the PCs with percent variance above a certain threshold indicates the number of weighted composites needed and reflects the dimensionality of the orthogonal space within which (almost) all the variance can be accounted for. The weights for forming composite scores are the listed loadings. For ease of interpretation it is often useful to change the sign of some composite scores.\nThe PCA for LMM m1 shows that each of the five PCs for Child accounts for a non-zero percent of unique variance.\nFor School fewer than seven PCs have unique variance. The exact number depends on sampling. The overparameterization of School might be resolved when the CPs for Sex are dropped from the LMM.\nCohort was estimated with CPs forced to zero. Therefore, the VCs were forced to be orthogonal; they already represent the PCA solution.

Age and sex effects in physical fitness components of 108,295 third graders including 515 primary schools and 9 cohorts. (Fühner et al., 2021)\nTo circumvent delays associated with model fitting we work with models that are less complex than those in the reference publication. All the data to reproduce the models in the publication are used here, too; the script requires only a few changes to specify the more complex models in the paper.\nAll children were between 6.0 and 6.99 years at legal keydate (30 September) of school enrollement, that is in their ninth year of life in the third grade. To avoid delays associated with model fitting we work with a reduced data set and less complex models than those in the reference publication. The script requires only a few changes to specify the more complex models in the paper.\nThe script is structured in three main sections:"

    "section": "2.1 SeqDiffCoding: contr1",
    "text": "2.1 SeqDiffCoding: contr1\nSeqDiffCoding was used in the publication. This specification tests pairwise differences between the five neighboring levels of Test, that is:\n\nSDC1: 2-1\nSDC2: 3-2\nSDC3: 4-3\nSDC4: 5-4\n\nThe levels were sorted such that these contrasts map onto four a priori hypotheses; in other words, they are theoretically motivated pairwise comparisons. The motivation also encompasses theoretically motivated interactions with Sex. The order of levels can also be explicitly specified during contrast construction. This is very useful if levels are in a different order in the dataframe. We recommend the explicit specification to increase transparency of the code.\nThe statistical disadvantage of SeqDiffCoding is that the contrasts are not orthogonal, that is the contrasts are correlated. This is obvious from the fact that levels 2, 3, and 4 are all used in two contrasts. One consequence of this is that correlation parameters estimated between neighboring contrasts (e.g., 2-1 and 3-2) are difficult to interpret. Usually, they will be negative because assuming some practical limitation on the overall range (e.g., between levels 1 and 3), a small “2-1” effect “correlates” negatively with a larger “3-2” effect for mathematical reasons.\nObviously, the tradeoff between theoretical motivation and statistical purity is something that must be considered carefully when planning the analysis.\n\ncontr1 = merge(\n  Dict(nm =&gt; Grouping() for nm in (:School, :Child, :Cohort)),\n  Dict(\n    :Sex =&gt; EffectsCoding(; levels=[\"Girls\", \"Boys\"]),\n    :Test =&gt; SeqDiffCoding(;\n      levels=[\"Run\", \"Star_r\", \"S20_r\", \"SLJ\", \"BPT\"]\n    ),\n  ),\n)\n\nDict{Symbol, StatsModels.AbstractContrasts} with 5 entries:\n  :Child  =&gt; Grouping()\n  :School =&gt; Grouping()\n  :Test   =&gt; SeqDiffCoding([\"Run\", \"Star_r\", \"S20_r\", \"SLJ\", \"BPT\"])\n  :Cohort =&gt; Grouping()\n  :Sex    =&gt; EffectsCoding(nothing, [\"Girls\", \"Boys\"])\n\n\n\nf_ovi_1 = @formula zScore ~ 1 + Test + (1 | Child);\n\n\nm_ovi_SeqDiff_1 = fit(MixedModel, f_ovi_1, dat; contrasts=contr1)\n\n\n\n\n\nEst.\nSE\nz\np\nσ_Child\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n0.0004\n0.0142\n0.03\n0.9751\n0.6789\n\n\nTest: Star_r\n0.0024\n0.0443\n0.05\n0.9563\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r\n-0.0072\n0.0445\n-0.16\n0.8708\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ\n0.0084\n0.0444\n0.19\n0.8492\n\n\n\nTest: BPT\n-0.0026\n0.0445\n-0.06\n0.9535\n\n\n\nResidual\n0.7334\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, any differences between tests identified by the contrasts would be spurious because each test was standardized (i.e., M=0, \\(SD\\)=1). The differences could also be due to an imbalance in the number of boys and girls or in the number of missing observations for each test.\nThe primary interest in this study related to interactions of the test contrasts with and age and Sex. We start with age (linear) and its interaction with the four test contrasts.\n\nm_ovi_SeqDiff_2 = let\n  form = @formula zScore ~ 1 + Test * a1 + (1 | Child)\n  fit(MixedModel, form, dat; contrasts=contr1)\nend\n\n\n\n\n\nEst.\nSE\nz\np\nσ_Child\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-0.0121\n0.0144\n-0.84\n0.4034\n0.6716\n\n\nTest: Star_r\n-0.0158\n0.0451\n-0.35\n0.7264\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r\n-0.0084\n0.0452\n-0.19\n0.8527\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ\n0.0167\n0.0451\n0.37\n0.7105\n\n\n\nTest: BPT\n-0.0119\n0.0448\n-0.26\n0.7916\n\n\n\na1\n0.2503\n0.0488\n5.13\n&lt;1e-06\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r & a1\n0.3294\n0.1513\n2.18\n0.0295\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r & a1\n-0.0051\n0.1531\n-0.03\n0.9736\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ & a1\n-0.0930\n0.1526\n-0.61\n0.5422\n\n\n\nTest: BPT & a1\n0.2838\n0.1514\n1.87\n0.0609\n\n\n\nResidual\n0.7349\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference between older and younger childrend is larger for Star_r than for Run (0.2473).

The sex difference is smaller when coordination and cognition play a role – as in the Star_r test. (Caveat: SEs are estimated with an underspecified RES.)\nThe final step in this first series is to add the interactions between the three covariates. A significant interaction between any of the four Test contrasts and age (linear) x Sex was hypothesized to reflect a prepubertal signal (i.e., hormones start to rise in girls’ ninth year of life). However, this hypothesis is linked to a specific shape of the interaction: Girls would need to gain more than boys in tests of muscular power.\n\nf_ovi = @formula zScore ~ 1 + Test * a1 * Sex + (1 | Child)\nm_ovi_SeqDiff = fit(MixedModel, f_ovi, dat; contrasts=contr1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEst.\nSE\nz\np\nσ_Child\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-0.0111\n0.0140\n-0.79\n0.4271\n0.6419\n\n\nTest: Star_r\n-0.0205\n0.0439\n-0.47\n0.6407\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r\n-0.0069\n0.0440\n-0.16\n0.8752\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ\n0.0172\n0.0439\n0.39\n0.6948\n\n\n\nTest: BPT\n-0.0121\n0.0437\n-0.28\n0.7818\n\n\n\na1\n0.2343\n0.0475\n4.93\n&lt;1e-06\n\n\n\nSex: Boys\n0.2054\n0.0140\n14.64\n&lt;1e-47\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r & a1\n0.3656\n0.1474\n2.48\n0.0131\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r & a1\n-0.0376\n0.1491\n-0.25\n0.8010\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ & a1\n-0.0947\n0.1487\n-0.64\n0.5240\n\n\n\nTest: BPT & a1\n0.3427\n0.1474\n2.32\n0.0201\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r & Sex: Boys\n-0.2302\n0.0439\n-5.25\n&lt;1e-06\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r & Sex: Boys\n0.1284\n0.0440\n2.92\n0.0035\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ & Sex: Boys\n0.0078\n0.0439\n0.18\n0.8596\n\n\n\nTest: BPT & Sex: Boys\n0.1675\n0.0437\n3.84\n0.0001\n\n\n\na1 & Sex: Boys\n0.0261\n0.0475\n0.55\n0.5822\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.1158\n0.1474\n0.79\n0.4320\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.1406\n0.1491\n0.94\n0.3456\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ & a1 & Sex: Boys\n-0.1030\n0.1487\n-0.69\n0.4885\n\n\n\nTest: BPT & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.1494\n0.1474\n1.01\n0.3110\n\n\n\nResidual\n0.7245\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results are very clear: Despite an abundance of statistical power there is no evidence for the differences between boys and girls in how much they gain in the ninth year of life in these five tests. The authors argue that, in this case, absence of evidence looks very much like evidence of absence of a hypothesized interaction.\nIn the next two sections we use different contrasts. Does this have a bearing on this result? We still ignore for now that we are looking at anti-conservative test statistics."

    "text": "2.2 HelmertCoding: contr2\nThe second set of contrasts uses HelmertCoding. Helmert coding codes each level as the difference from the average of the lower levels. With the default order of Test levels we get the following test statistics which we describe in reverse order of appearance in model output\n\nHeC4: 5 - mean(1,2,3,4)\nHeC3: 4 - mean(1,2,3)\nHeC2: 3 - mean(1,2)\nHeC1: 2 - 1\n\nIn the model output, HeC1 will be reported first and HeC4 last.\nThere is some justification for the HeC4 specification in a post-hoc manner because the fifth test (BPT) turned out to be different from the other four tests in that high performance is most likely not only related to physical fitness, but also to overweight/obesity, that is for a subset of children high scores on this test might be indicative of physical unfitness. A priori the SDC4 contrast 5-4 between BPT (5) and SLJ (4) was motivated because conceptually both are tests of the physical fitness component Muscular Power, BPT for upper limbs and SLJ for lower limbs, respectively.\nOne could argue that there is justification for HeC3 because Run (1), Star_r (2), and S20 (3) involve running but SLJ (4) does not. Sports scientists, however, recoil. For them it does not make much sense to average the different running tests, because they draw on completely different physiological resources; it is a variant of the old apples-and-oranges problem.\nThe justification for HeC3 is thatRun (1) and Star_r (2) draw more strongly on cardiosrespiratory Endurance than S20 (3) due to the longer duration of the runs compared to sprinting for 20 m which is a pure measure of the physical-fitness component Speed. Again, sports scientists are not very happy with this proposal.\nFinally, HeC1 contrasts the fitness components Endurance, indicated best by Run (1), and Coordination, indicated by Star_r (2). Endurance (i.e., running for 6 minutes) is considered to be the best indicator of health-related status among the five tests because it is a rather pure measure of cardiorespiratory fitness. The Star_r test requires execution of a pre-instructed sequence of forward, sideways, and backward runs. This coordination of body movements implies a demand on working memory (i.e., remembering the order of these subruns) and executive control processes, but performats also depends on endurance. HeC1 yields a measure of Coordination “corrected” for the contribution of Endurance.\nThe statistical advantage of HelmertCoding is that the resulting contrasts are orthogonal (uncorrelated). This allows for optimal partitioning of variance and statistical power. It is also more efficient to estimate “orthogonal” than “non-orthogonal” random-effect structures.\n\ncontr2 = Dict(\n  :School =&gt; Grouping(),\n  :Child =&gt; Grouping(),\n  :Cohort =&gt; Grouping(),\n  :Sex =&gt; EffectsCoding(; levels=[\"Girls\", \"Boys\"]),\n  :Test =&gt; HelmertCoding(;\n    levels=[\"Run\", \"Star_r\", \"S20_r\", \"SLJ\", \"BPT\"],\n  ),\n);\n\n\nm_ovi_Helmert = fit(MixedModel, f_ovi, dat; contrasts=contr2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEst.\nSE\nz\np\nσ_Child\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-0.0111\n0.0140\n-0.79\n0.4271\n0.6419\n\n\nTest: Star_r\n-0.0102\n0.0219\n-0.47\n0.6407\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r\n-0.0057\n0.0127\n-0.45\n0.6537\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ\n0.0014\n0.0089\n0.16\n0.8715\n\n\n\nTest: BPT\n-0.0016\n0.0069\n-0.22\n0.8222\n\n\n\na1\n0.2343\n0.0475\n4.93\n&lt;1e-06\n\n\n\nSex: Boys\n0.2054\n0.0140\n14.64\n&lt;1e-47\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r & a1\n0.1828\n0.0737\n2.48\n0.0131\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r & a1\n0.0484\n0.0434\n1.12\n0.2648\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ & a1\n0.0005\n0.0300\n0.02\n0.9863\n\n\n\nTest: BPT & a1\n0.0689\n0.0235\n2.93\n0.0034\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r & Sex: Boys\n-0.1151\n0.0219\n-5.25\n&lt;1e-06\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r & Sex: Boys\n0.0044\n0.0127\n0.35\n0.7285\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ & Sex: Boys\n0.0042\n0.0089\n0.46\n0.6422\n\n\n\nTest: BPT & Sex: Boys\n0.0360\n0.0069\n5.22\n&lt;1e-06\n\n\n\na1 & Sex: Boys\n0.0261\n0.0475\n0.55\n0.5822\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.0579\n0.0737\n0.79\n0.4320\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.0662\n0.0434\n1.52\n0.1273\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.0073\n0.0300\n0.24\n0.8065\n\n\n\nTest: BPT & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.0343\n0.0235\n1.46\n0.1448\n\n\n\nResidual\n0.7245\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe forego a detailed discussion of the effects, but note that again none of the interactions between age x Sex with the four test contrasts was significant.\nThe default labeling of Helmert contrasts may lead to confusions with other contrasts.

Unfortunately, it is not easy, actually rather quite difficult, to grasp the meaning of correlations of contrast-based effects; they represent two-way interactions.\n\nbegin\n  f_Child = @formula zScore ~\n    1 + Test * a1 * Sex + (1 + Test | Child)\n  m_Child_SDC = fit(MixedModel, f_Child, dat; contrasts=contr1)\n  m_Child_HeC = fit(MixedModel, f_Child, dat; contrasts=contr2)\n  m_Child_HyC = fit(MixedModel, f_Child, dat; contrasts=contr3)\n  m_Child_PCA = fit(MixedModel, f_Child, dat; contrasts=contr4)\nend\n\nMinimizing 1950      Time: 0:00:13 ( 6.72 ms/it)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEst.\nSE\nz\np\nσ_Child\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-0.0110\n0.0140\n-0.79\n0.4308\n0.6519\n\n\nTest: c5.1\n-0.0242\n0.0423\n-0.57\n0.5668\n1.3179\n\n\nTest: c234.15\n-0.0461\n0.1671\n-0.28\n0.7827\n0.6667\n\n\nTest: c2.34\n0.0021\n0.0787\n0.03\n0.9788\n1.8271\n\n\nTest: c3.4\n-0.0083\n0.0448\n-0.18\n0.8533\n1.4953\n\n\na1\n0.2331\n0.0474\n4.92\n&lt;1e-06\n\n\n\nSex: Boys\n0.2048\n0.0140\n14.60\n&lt;1e-47\n\n\n\nTest: c5.1 & a1\n0.5929\n0.1436\n4.13\n&lt;1e-04\n\n\n\nTest: c234.15 & a1\n-0.0154\n0.5658\n-0.03\n0.9783\n\n\n\nTest: c2.34 & a1\n0.1206\n0.2648\n0.46\n0.6487\n\n\n\nTest: c3.4 & a1\n0.0798\n0.1516\n0.53\n0.5987\n\n\n\nTest: c5.1 & Sex: Boys\n0.0724\n0.0423\n1.71\n0.0869\n\n\n\nTest: c234.15 & Sex: Boys\n-1.0798\n0.1671\n-6.46\n&lt;1e-09\n\n\n\nTest: c2.34 & Sex: Boys\n-0.2711\n0.0787\n-3.44\n0.0006\n\n\n\nTest: c3.4 & Sex: Boys\n-0.0022\n0.0448\n-0.05\n0.9600\n\n\n\na1 & Sex: Boys\n0.0268\n0.0474\n0.57\n0.5716\n\n\n\nTest: c5.1 & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.3061\n0.1436\n2.13\n0.0330\n\n\n\nTest: c234.15 & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.2638\n0.5658\n0.47\n0.6411\n\n\n\nTest: c2.34 & a1 & Sex: Boys\n-0.1418\n0.2648\n-0.54\n0.5924\n\n\n\nTest: c3.4 & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.1002\n0.1516\n0.66\n0.5086\n\n\n\nResidual\n0.0000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarCorr(m_Child_SDC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nVariance\nStd.Dev\nCorr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChild\n(Intercept)\n0.38814366\n0.62301177\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r\n0.71106028\n0.84324390\n-0.08\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r\n2.39319151\n1.54699435\n+0.04\n-0.61\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ\n1.17777446\n1.08525318\n+0.18\n+0.85\n-0.76\n\n\n\n\nTest: BPT\n0.73820303\n0.85918742\n-0.22\n-0.80\n+0.60\n-0.65\n\n\nResidual\n\n0.00000000\n0.00001156\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarCorr(m_Child_HeC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nVariance\nStd.Dev\nCorr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChild\n(Intercept)\n0.17556736\n0.41900759\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r\n0.18125770\n0.42574370\n+0.06\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r\n0.14576143\n0.38178716\n-0.51\n-0.16\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ\n0.09536058\n0.30880509\n-0.39\n+0.30\n-0.38\n\n\n\n\nTest: BPT\n0.07105630\n0.26656388\n-0.50\n-0.17\n+0.02\n-0.13\n\n\nResidual\n\n0.00000000\n0.00002550\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarCorr(m_Child_HyC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nVariance\nStd.Dev\nCorr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChild\n(Intercept)\n0.39076164\n0.62510930\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: BPT-other\n2.25670524\n1.50223342\n+0.89\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: Star-End\n1.13661285\n1.06612047\n+0.37\n+0.59\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: S20-Star\n1.91433239\n1.38359401\n-0.20\n+0.17\n-0.04\n\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ-S20\n1.20421295\n1.09736637\n+0.32\n-0.01\n-0.35\n-0.51\n\n\nResidual\n\n0.00000000\n0.00000819\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarCorr(m_Child_PCA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nVariance\nStd.Dev\nCorr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChild\n(Intercept)\n0.42502177\n0.65193693\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: c5.1\n1.73689903\n1.31791465\n+0.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: c234.15\n0.44455305\n0.66674811\n-0.04\n+0.45\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: c2.34\n3.33838143\n1.82712381\n+0.33\n+0.10\n-0.56\n\n\n\n\nTest: c3.4\n2.23577343\n1.49525029\n-0.08\n-0.01\n-0.38\n-0.23\n\n\nResidual\n\n0.00000000\n0.00000724\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CPs for the various contrasts are in line with expectations. For the SDC we observe substantial negative CPs between neighboring contrasts. For the orthogonal HeC, all CPs are small; they are uncorrelated. HyC contains some of the SDC contrasts and we observe again the negative CPs. The (roughly) PCA-based contrasts are small with one exception; there is a sizeable CP of +.41 between GM and the core of adjusted physical fitness (c234.15).\nDo these differences in CPs imply that we can move to zcpLMMs when we have orthogonal contrasts? We pursue this question with by refitting the four LMMs with zerocorr() and compare the goodness of fit.\n\nbegin\n  f_Child0 = @formula zScore ~\n    1 + Test * a1 * Sex + zerocorr(1 + Test | Child)\n  m_Child_SDC0 = fit(MixedModel, f_Child0, dat; contrasts=contr1)\n  m_Child_HeC0 = fit(MixedModel, f_Child0, dat; contrasts=contr2)\n  m_Child_HyC0 = fit(MixedModel, f_Child0, dat; contrasts=contr3)\n  m_Child_PCA0 = fit(MixedModel, f_Child0, dat; contrasts=contr4)\nend\n\nMinimizing 607   Time: 0:00:02 ( 4.33 ms/it)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEst.\nSE\nz\np\nσ_Child\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-0.0114\n0.0140\n-0.81\n0.4176\n0.6845\n\n\nTest: c5.1\n-0.0244\n0.0427\n-0.57\n0.5678\n1.2895\n\n\nTest: c234.15\n-0.0489\n0.1679\n-0.29\n0.7708\n0.2514\n\n\nTest: c2.34\n-0.0061\n0.0775\n-0.08\n0.9377\n2.1109\n\n\nTest: c3.4\n-0.0158\n0.0449\n-0.35\n0.7254\n1.2300\n\n\na1\n0.2329\n0.0474\n4.91\n&lt;1e-06\n\n\n\nSex: Boys\n0.2053\n0.0140\n14.64\n&lt;1e-47\n\n\n\nTest: c5.1 & a1\n0.5913\n0.1450\n4.08\n&lt;1e-04\n\n\n\nTest: c234.15 & a1\n0.0646\n0.5683\n0.11\n0.9095\n\n\n\nTest: c2.34 & a1\n0.1495\n0.2603\n0.57\n0.5658\n\n\n\nTest: c3.4 & a1\n0.0955\n0.1519\n0.63\n0.5295\n\n\n\nTest: c5.1 & Sex: Boys\n0.0730\n0.0427\n1.71\n0.0877\n\n\n\nTest: c234.15 & Sex: Boys\n-1.0720\n0.1679\n-6.39\n&lt;1e-09\n\n\n\nTest: c2.34 & Sex: Boys\n-0.2732\n0.0775\n-3.53\n0.0004\n\n\n\nTest: c3.4 & Sex: Boys\n-0.0045\n0.0449\n-0.10\n0.9203\n\n\n\na1 & Sex: Boys\n0.0255\n0.0474\n0.54\n0.5907\n\n\n\nTest: c5.1 & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.3049\n0.1450\n2.10\n0.0355\n\n\n\nTest: c234.15 & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.1398\n0.5683\n0.25\n0.8057\n\n\n\nTest: c2.34 & a1 & Sex: Boys\n-0.1536\n0.2603\n-0.59\n0.5551\n\n\n\nTest: c3.4 & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.1031\n0.1519\n0.68\n0.4974\n\n\n\nResidual\n0.0000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixedModels.likelihoodratiotest(m_Child_SDC0, m_Child_SDC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel-dof\ndeviance\nχ²\nχ²-dof\nP(&gt;χ²)\n\n\n\n\nzScore ~ 1 + Test + a1 + Sex + Test & a1 + Test & Sex + a1 & Sex + Test & a1 & Sex + zerocorr(1 + Test | Child)\n26\n13834\n\n\n\n\n\nzScore ~ 1 + Test + a1 + Sex + Test & a1 + Test & Sex + a1 & Sex + Test & a1 & Sex + (1 + Test | Child)\n36\n13262\n572\n10\n&lt;1e-99\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixedModels.likelihoodratiotest(m_Child_HeC0, m_Child_HeC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel-dof\ndeviance\nχ²\nχ²-dof\nP(&gt;χ²)\n\n\n\n\nzScore ~ 1 + Test + a1 + Sex + Test & a1 + Test & Sex + a1 & Sex + Test & a1 & Sex + zerocorr(1 + Test | Child)\n26\n13227\n\n\n\n\n\nzScore ~ 1 + Test + a1 + Sex + Test & a1 + Test & Sex + a1 & Sex + Test & a1 & Sex + (1 + Test | Child)\n36\n13307\n-81\n10\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixedModels.likelihoodratiotest(m_Child_HyC0, m_Child_HyC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel-dof\ndeviance\nχ²\nχ²-dof\nP(&gt;χ²)\n\n\n\n\nzScore ~ 1 + Test + a1 + Sex + Test & a1 + Test & Sex + a1 & Sex + Test & a1 & Sex + zerocorr(1 + Test | Child)\n26\n13828\n\n\n\n\n\nzScore ~ 1 + Test + a1 + Sex + Test & a1 + Test & Sex + a1 & Sex + Test & a1 & Sex + (1 + Test | Child)\n36\n13248\n580\n10\n&lt;1e-99\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixedModels.likelihoodratiotest(m_Child_PCA0, m_Child_PCA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel-dof\ndeviance\nχ²\nχ²-dof\nP(&gt;χ²)\n\n\n\n\nzScore ~ 1 + Test + a1 + Sex + Test & a1 + Test & Sex + a1 & Sex + Test & a1 & Sex + zerocorr(1 + Test | Child)\n26\n13246\n\n\n\n\n\nzScore ~ 1 + Test + a1 + Sex + Test & a1 + Test & Sex + a1 & Sex + Test & a1 & Sex + (1 + Test | Child)\n36\n13237\n9\n10\n0.4888\n\n\n\n\n\nObviously, we can not drop CPs from any of the LMMs. The full LMMs all have the same objective, but we can compare the goodness-of-fit statistics of zcpLMMs more directly.\n\nbegin\n  zcpLMM = [\"SDC0\", \"HeC0\", \"HyC0\", \"PCA0\"]\n  mods = [m_Child_SDC0, m_Child_HeC0, m_Child_HyC0, m_Child_PCA0]\n  gof_summary = sort!(\n    DataFrame(;\n      zcpLMM=zcpLMM,\n      dof=dof.(mods),\n      deviance=deviance.(mods),\n      AIC=aic.(mods),\n      BIC=bic.(mods),\n    ),\n    :deviance,\n  )\nend\n\n4×5 DataFrame\n\n\n\nRow\nzcpLMM\ndof\ndeviance\nAIC\nBIC\n\n\n\nString\nInt64\nFloat64\nFloat64\nFloat64\n\n\n\n\n1\nHeC0\n26\n13226.5\n13278.5\n13447.9\n\n\n2\nPCA0\n26\n13246.4\n13298.4\n13467.9\n\n\n3\nHyC0\n26\n13828.1\n13880.1\n14049.5\n\n\n4\nSDC0\n26\n13834.1\n13886.1\n14055.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best fit was obtained for the PCA-based zcpLMM. Somewhat surprisingly the second best fit was obtained for the SDC. The relatively poor performance of HeC-based zcpLMM is puzzling to me. I thought it might be related to imbalance in design in the present data, but this does not appear to be the case. The same comparison of SequentialDifferenceCoding and Helmert Coding also showed a worse fit for the zcp-HeC LMM than the zcp-SDC LMM."

    "text": "The speed of MixedModels.jl relative to its predecessors makes the parametric bootstrap much more computationally tractable. This is valuable because the parametric bootstrap can be used to produce more accurate confidence intervals than methods based on standard errors or profiling of the likelihood surface.\nThis page is adapted from the MixedModels.jl docs\n\n1 The parametric bootstrap\nBootstrapping is a family of procedures for generating sample values of a statistic, allowing for visualization of the distribution of the statistic or for inference from this sample of values. Bootstrapping also belongs to a larger family of procedures called resampling, which are based on creating new samples of data from an existing one, then computing statistics on the new samples, in order to examine the distribution of the relevant statistics.\nA parametric bootstrap is used with a parametric model, m, that has been fit to data. The procedure is to simulate n response vectors from m using the estimated parameter values and refit m to these responses in turn, accumulating the statistics of interest at each iteration.\nThe parameters of a LinearMixedModel object are the fixed-effects parameters, β, the standard deviation, σ, of the per-observation noise, and the covariance parameter, θ, that defines the variance-covariance matrices of the random effects. A technical description of the covariance parameter can be found in the MixedModels.jl docs. Lisa Schwetlick and Daniel Backhaus have provided a more beginner-friendly description of the covariance parameter in the documentation for MixedModelsSim.jl. For today’s purposes – looking at the uncertainty in the estimates from a fitted model – we can simply use values from the fitted model, but we will revisit the parametric bootstrap as a convenient way to simulate new data, potentially with different parameter values, for power analysis.\nFor example, a simple linear mixed-effects model for the Dyestuff data in the lme4 package for R is fit by\n\nusing AlgebraOfGraphics\nusing CairoMakie\nusing DataFrames\nusing MixedModels\nusing MixedModelsMakie\nusing ProgressMeter\nusing Random\n\nusing AlgebraOfGraphics: AlgebraOfGraphics as AoG\nCairoMakie.activate!(; type=\"svg\") # use SVG (other options include PNG)\nProgressMeter.ijulia_behavior(:clear);\n\nNote that the precise stream of random numbers generated for a given seed can change between Julia versions. For exact reproducibility, you either need to have the exact same Julia version or use the StableRNGs package.\n\n\n2 A model of moderate complexity\nThe kb07 data (Kronmüller & Barr, 2007) are one of the datasets provided by the MixedModels package.\n\nkb07 = MixedModels.dataset(:kb07)\n\nArrow.Table with 1789 rows, 7 columns, and schema:\n :subj      String\n :item      String\n :spkr      String\n :prec      String\n :load      String\n :rt_trunc  Int16\n :rt_raw    Int16\n\n\nConvert the table to a DataFrame for summary.\n\nkb07 = DataFrame(kb07)\ndescribe(kb07)\n\n7×7 DataFrame\n\n\n\nRow\nvariable\nmean\nmin\nmedian\nmax\nnmissing\neltype\n\n\n\nSymbol\nUnion…\nAny\nUnion…\nAny\nInt64\nDataType\n\n\n\n\n1\nsubj\n\nS030\n\nS103\n0\nString\n\n\n2\nitem\n\nI01\n\nI32\n0\nString\n\n\n3\nspkr\n\nnew\n\nold\n0\nString\n\n\n4\nprec\n\nbreak\n\nmaintain\n0\nString\n\n\n5\nload\n\nno\n\nyes\n0\nString\n\n\n6\nrt_trunc\n2182.2\n579\n1940.0\n5171\n0\nInt16\n\n\n7\nrt_raw\n2226.24\n579\n1940.0\n15923\n0\nInt16\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe experimental factors; spkr, prec, and load, are two-level factors.\n\ncontrasts = Dict(:spkr =&gt; EffectsCoding(),\n                 :prec =&gt; EffectsCoding(),\n                 :load =&gt; EffectsCoding(),\n                 :subj =&gt; Grouping(),\n                 :item =&gt; Grouping())\n\nDict{Symbol, StatsModels.AbstractContrasts} with 5 entries:\n  :item =&gt; Grouping()\n  :spkr =&gt; EffectsCoding(nothing, nothing)\n  :load =&gt; EffectsCoding(nothing, nothing)\n  :prec =&gt; EffectsCoding(nothing, nothing)\n  :subj =&gt; Grouping()\n\n\nThe EffectsCoding contrast is used with these to create a ±1 encoding. Furthermore, Grouping constrasts are assigned to the subj and item factors. This is not a contrast per-se but an indication that these factors will be used as grouping factors for random effects and, therefore, there is no need to create a contrast matrix. For large numbers of levels in a grouping factor, an attempt to create a contrast matrix may cause memory overflow.\nIt is not important in these cases but a good practice in any case.\nWe can look at an initial fit of moderate complexity:\n\nform = @formula(rt_trunc ~ 1 + spkr * prec * load +\n                          (1 + spkr + prec + load | subj) +\n                          (1 + spkr + prec + load | item))\nm0 = fit(MixedModel, form, kb07; contrasts)\n\nMinimizing 934   Time: 0:00:01 ( 1.38 ms/it)\n  objective:  28637.97101024215\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEst.\nSE\nz\np\nσ_subj\nσ_item\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n2181.6424\n77.3512\n28.20\n&lt;1e-99\n301.8676\n362.4694\n\n\nspkr: old\n67.7496\n17.9607\n3.77\n0.0002\n33.0524\n41.1185\n\n\nprec: maintain\n-333.9200\n47.1564\n-7.08\n&lt;1e-11\n58.8607\n247.3292\n\n\nload: yes\n78.8007\n19.7260\n3.99\n&lt;1e-04\n66.9505\n43.3885\n\n\nspkr: old & prec: maintain\n-21.9960\n15.8191\n-1.39\n0.1644\n\n\n\n\nspkr: old & load: yes\n18.3832\n15.8191\n1.16\n0.2452\n\n\n\n\nprec: maintain & load: yes\n4.5327\n15.8191\n0.29\n0.7745\n\n\n\n\nspkr: old & prec: maintain & load: yes\n23.6377\n15.8191\n1.49\n0.1351\n\n\n\n\nResidual\n669.0516\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default display in Quarto uses the pretty MIME show method for the model and omits the estimated correlations of the random effects.\nThe VarCorr extractor displays these.\n\nVarCorr(m0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nVariance\nStd.Dev\nCorr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsubj\n(Intercept)\n91124.0779\n301.8676\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspkr: old\n1092.4628\n33.0524\n+1.00\n\n\n\n\n\nprec: maintain\n3464.5848\n58.8607\n-0.62\n-0.62\n\n\n\n\nload: yes\n4482.3662\n66.9505\n+0.36\n+0.36\n+0.51\n\n\nitem\n(Intercept)\n131384.0733\n362.4694\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspkr: old\n1690.7347\n41.1185\n+0.42\n\n\n\n\n\nprec: maintain\n61171.7458\n247.3292\n-0.69\n+0.37\n\n\n\n\nload: yes\n1882.5594\n43.3885\n+0.29\n+0.14\n-0.13\n\n\nResidual\n\n447630.0111\n669.0516\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone of the two-factor or three-factor interaction terms in the fixed-effects are significant.

We refer to these as “coverage intervals”, similar to a confidence interval. The shortest such intervals, obtained with the shortestcovint extractor, correspond to a highest posterior density interval in Bayesian inference.\nWe generate these for all random and fixed effects:\n\nshortestcovint(samp)\n\n13-element Vector{NamedTuple{(:type, :group, :names, :lower, :upper)}}:\n (type = \"β\", group = missing, names = \"(Intercept)\", lower = 2028.4504684663298, upper = 2335.498038554574)\n (type = \"β\", group = missing, names = \"spkr: old\", lower = 33.90584062173727, upper = 97.10171233641093)\n (type = \"β\", group = missing, names = \"prec: maintain\", lower = -420.9759788935399, upper = -246.9263080177159)\n (type = \"β\", group = missing, names = \"load: yes\", lower = 49.939730827892056, upper = 108.72371421725681)\n (type = \"β\", group = missing, names = \"spkr: old & prec: maintain\", lower = -52.84340405357466, upper = 8.707634564888837)\n (type = \"β\", group = missing, names = \"spkr: old & load: yes\", lower = -11.990358739323007, upper = 49.09084416150385)\n (type = \"β\", group = missing, names = \"prec: maintain & load: yes\", lower = -25.207700054695998, upper = 36.98654156979304)\n (type = \"β\", group = missing, names = \"spkr: old & prec: maintain & load: yes\", lower = -5.885146326787089, upper = 54.77034471400362)\n (type = \"σ\", group = \"item\", names = \"(Intercept)\", lower = 267.2821884396632, upper = 462.8203408672154)\n (type = \"σ\", group = \"item\", names = \"prec: maintain\", lower = 178.1489090587561, upper = 316.2287416548999)\n (type = \"ρ\", group = \"item\", names = \"(Intercept), prec: maintain\", lower = -0.9058618744930751, upper = -0.4813912713068965)\n (type = \"σ\", group = \"subj\", names = \"(Intercept)\", lower = 231.87615523560174, upper = 356.151666966933)\n (type = \"σ\", group = \"residual\", names = missing, lower = 653.5649114745823, upper = 700.7662324102956)\n\n\nand convert it to a dataframe:\n\nDataFrame(shortestcovint(samp))\n\n13×5 DataFrame\n\n\n\nRow\ntype\ngroup\nnames\nlower\nupper\n\n\n\nString\nString?\nString?\nFloat64\nFloat64\n\n\n\n\n1\nβ\nmissing\n(Intercept)\n2028.45\n2335.5\n\n\n2\nβ\nmissing\nspkr: old\n33.9058\n97.1017\n\n\n3\nβ\nmissing\nprec: maintain\n-420.976\n-246.926\n\n\n4\nβ\nmissing\nload: yes\n49.9397\n108.724\n\n\n5\nβ\nmissing\nspkr: old & prec: maintain\n-52.8434\n8.70763\n\n\n6\nβ\nmissing\nspkr: old & load: yes\n-11.9904\n49.0908\n\n\n7\nβ\nmissing\nprec: maintain & load: yes\n-25.2077\n36.9865\n\n\n8\nβ\nmissing\nspkr: old & prec: maintain & load: yes\n-5.88515\n54.7703\n\n\n9\nσ\nitem\n(Intercept)\n267.282\n462.82\n\n\n10\nσ\nitem\nprec: maintain\n178.149\n316.229\n\n\n11\nρ\nitem\n(Intercept), prec: maintain\n-0.905862\n-0.481391\n\n\n12\nσ\nsubj\n(Intercept)\n231.876\n356.152\n\n\n13\nσ\nresidual\nmissing\n653.565\n700.766\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndraw(\n  data(samp.β) * mapping(:β;

It is easy to detect the singularity in the case of a scalar random-effects term.

In some ways this is the most complicated expression in creating the plot so we will break it down. select is applied to DataFrame(dat), which is the conversion of the Arrow.Table, dat, to a DataFrame. This is necessary because an Arrow.Table is immutable but a DataFrame can be modified.\nThe arguments after the DataFrame describe how to modify the contents. The first : indicates that all the existing columns should be included. The other expression can be pairs (created with the =&gt; operator) of the form :col =&gt; function or of the form :col =&gt; function =&gt; :newname. (See the documentation of the DataFrames package for details.)\nIn this case the function is an anonymous function of the form round.(x, digits=1) where “dot-broadcasting” is used to apply to the entire column (see this documentation for details).\n\ntransform!(df, :age, :age =&gt; (x -&gt; x .- 8.5) =&gt; :a1) # centered age (linear)\nselect!(groupby(df, :Test), :, :score =&gt; zscore =&gt; :zScore) # z-score\ntlabels = [     # establish order and labels of tbl.Test\n  \"Run\" =&gt; \"Endurance\",\n  \"Star_r\" =&gt; \"Coordination\",\n  \"S20_r\" =&gt; \"Speed\",\n  \"SLJ\" =&gt; \"PowerLOW\",\n  \"BPT\" =&gt; \"PowerUP\",\n];\n\nThe next stage is a group-apply-combine operation to group the rows by Sex, Test and rnd_age then apply mean to the zScore and also apply length to zScore to record the number in each group.\n\ndf2 = combine(\n  groupby(\n    select(df, :, :age =&gt; ByRow(x -&gt; round(x; digits=1)) =&gt; :age),\n    [:Sex, :Test, :age],\n  ),\n  :zScore =&gt; mean =&gt; :zScore,\n  :zScore =&gt; length =&gt; :n,\n)\n\n120×5 DataFrame95 rows omitted\n\n\n\nRow\nSex\nTest\nage\nzScore\nn\n\n\n\nString\nString\nFloat64\nFloat64\nInt64\n\n\n\n\n1\nmale\nS20_r\n8.0\n-0.0265138\n1223\n\n\n2\nmale\nBPT\n8.0\n0.026973\n1227\n\n\n3\nmale\nSLJ\n8.0\n0.121609\n1227\n\n\n4\nmale\nStar_r\n8.0\n-0.0571726\n1186\n\n\n5\nmale\nRun\n8.0\n0.292695\n1210\n\n\n6\nfemale\nS20_r\n8.0\n-0.35164\n1411\n\n\n7\nfemale\nBPT\n8.0\n-0.610355\n1417\n\n\n8\nfemale\nSLJ\n8.0\n-0.279872\n1418\n\n\n9\nfemale\nStar_r\n8.0\n-0.268221\n1381\n\n\n10\nfemale\nRun\n8.0\n-0.245573\n1387\n\n\n11\nmale\nS20_r\n8.1\n0.0608397\n3042\n\n\n12\nmale\nBPT\n8.1\n0.0955413\n3069\n\n\n13\nmale\nSLJ\n8.1\n0.123099\n3069\n\n\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n\n\n109\nmale\nStar_r\n9.0\n0.254973\n4049\n\n\n110\nmale\nRun\n9.0\n0.258082\n4034\n\n\n111\nfemale\nS20_r\n9.1\n-0.0286172\n1154\n\n\n112\nfemale\nBPT\n9.1\n-0.0752301\n1186\n\n\n113\nfemale\nSLJ\n9.1\n-0.094587\n1174\n\n\n114\nfemale\nStar_r\n9.1\n0.00276252\n1162\n\n\n115\nfemale\nRun\n9.1\n-0.235591\n1150\n\n\n116\nmale\nS20_r\n9.1\n0.325745\n1303\n\n\n117\nmale\nBPT\n9.1\n0.616416\n1320\n\n\n118\nmale\nSLJ\n9.1\n0.267577\n1310\n\n\n119\nmale\nStar_r\n9.1\n0.254342\n1297\n\n\n120\nmale\nRun\n9.1\n0.251045\n1294\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Creating the plot\nThe AlgebraOfGraphics package applies operators to the results of functions such as data (specify the data table to be used), mapping (designate the roles of columns), and visual (type of visual presentation).\n\nlet\n  design = mapping(:age, :zScore; color=:Sex, col=:Test)\n  lines = design * linear()\n  means = design * visual(Scatter; markersize=5)\n  draw(data(df2) * means + data(df) * lines)\nend\n\n\n\n\n\nTBD: Relabel factor levels (Boys, Girls; fitness components for Test)\nTBD: Relevel factors; why not levels from Tables?\nTBD: Set range (7.8 to 9.2 and tick marks (8, 8.5, 9) of axes.\nTBD: Move legend in plot?\n\n\n\nFühner, T., Granacher, U., Golle, K., & Kliegl, R.

    "text": "1 The Arrow storage format\nThe Arrow storage format provides a language-agnostic storage and memory specification for columnar data tables, which just means “something that looks like a data frame in R”. That is, an arrow table is an ordered, named collection of columns, all of the same length.\nThe columns can be of different types including numeric values, character strings, and factor-like representations - called DictEncoded.\nAn Arrow file can be read or written from R, Python, Julia and many other languages. Somewhat confusingly in R and Python the name feather, which refers to an earlier version of the storage format, is used in some function names like read_feather.\nInternally, the SMLP2023 package uses Arrow to store all of its datasets.\n\n\n2 The Emotikon data\nThe SMLP2021 repository contains a version of the data from Fühner et al. (2021) in notebooks/data/fggk21.arrow. After that file was created there were changes in the master RDS file on the osf.io site for the project. We will recreate the Arrow file here then split it into two separate tables, one with a row for each child in the study and one with a row for each test result.\nThe Arrow package for Julia does not export any function names, which means that the function to read an Arrow file must be called as Arrow.Table. It returns a column table, as described in the Tables package.

Each row of df is determined by a combination of Child and Test, together producing a score, which can be converted to a zScore.\nThe other columns in the table, Cohort, School, age, and Sex, are properties of the Child.\nStoring these values redundantly in the full table takes up space but, more importantly, allows for inconsistency. As it stands, a given Child could be recorded as being in one Cohort for the Run test and in another Cohort for the S20_r test and nothing about the table would detect this as being an error.\nThe approach used in relational databases is to store the information for score in one table that contains only Child, Test and score, store the information for the Child in another table including Cohort, School, age and Sex. These tables can then be combined to create the table to be used for analysis by joining the different tables together.\nThe maintainers of the DataFrames package have put in a lot of work over the past few years to make joins quite efficient in Julia. Thus the processing penalty of reassembling the big table from three smaller tables is minimal.\nIt is important to note that the main advantage of using smaller tables that are joined together to produce the analysis table is the fact that the information in the analysis table is consistent by design.\n\n\n5 Creating the smaller table\n\nChild = unique(select(df, :Child, :School, :Cohort, :Sex, :age))\n\n108295×5 DataFrame108270 rows omitted\n\n\n\nRow\nChild\nSchool\nCohort\nSex\nage\n\n\n\nString\nString\nString\nString\nFloat64\n\n\n\n\n1\nC002352\nS100067\n2013\nmale\n7.99452\n\n\n2\nC002353\nS100067\n2013\nmale\n7.99452\n\n\n3\nC002354\nS100067\n2013\nmale\n7.99452\n\n\n4\nC002355\nS100122\n2013\nfemale\n7.99452\n\n\n5\nC002356\nS100146\n2013\nmale\n7.99452\n\n\n6\nC002357\nS100146\n2013\nmale\n7.99452\n\n\n7\nC002358\nS100146\n2013\nmale\n7.99452\n\n\n8\nC002359\nS100183\n2013\nfemale\n7.99452\n\n\n9\nC002360\nS100195\n2013\nfemale\n7.99452\n\n\n10\nC002361\nS100213\n2013\nmale\n7.99452\n\n\n11\nC002362\nS100237\n2013\nfemale\n7.99452\n\n\n12\nC002363\nS100237\n2013\nfemale\n7.99452\n\n\n13\nC002364\nS100250\n2013\nfemale\n7.99452\n\n\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n\n\n108284\nC117943\nS130539\n2018\nfemale\n9.10609\n\n\n108285\nC117944\nS130539\n2018\nmale\n9.10609\n\n\n108286\nC117945\nS130539\n2018\nmale\n9.10609\n\n\n108287\nC117946\nS130539\n2018\nmale\n9.10609\n\n\n108288\nC117956\nS400580\n2018\nmale\n9.10609\n\n\n108289\nC117957\nS400919\n2018\nmale\n9.10609\n\n\n108290\nC117958\nS400919\n2018\nmale\n9.10609\n\n\n108291\nC117959\nS400919\n2018\nmale\n9.10609\n\n\n108292\nC117962\nS401250\n2018\nfemale\n9.10609\n\n\n108293\nC117964\nS401470\n2018\nmale\n9.10609\n\n\n108294\nC117965\nS401470\n2018\nfemale\n9.10609\n\n\n108295\nC117966\nS800200\n2018\nmale\n9.10609\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlength(unique(Child.Child))  # should be 108295\n\n108295\n\n\n\nfilesize(\n  Arrow.write(\"./data/fggk21_Child.arrow\", Child; compress=:lz4)\n)\n\n1774946\n\n\n\nfilesize(\n  Arrow.write(\n    \"./data/fggk21_Score.arrow\",\n    select(df, :Child, :Test, :score);\n    compress=:lz4,\n  ),\n)\n\n2794058\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA careful examination of the file sizes versus that of ./data/fggk21.arrow will show that the separate tables combined take up more space than the original because of the compression.

    "text": "In Fühner et al. (2021) the original metric of two tasks (Star, S20) is time, but they were transformed to speed scores in the publication prior to computing z-scores. The critical result is the absence of evidence for the age x Sex x Test interaction. Is this interaction significant if we analyse all tasks in their original metric?\nFitting the LMM of the publication takes time, roughly 1 hour. However, if you save the model parameters (and other relevant information), you can restore the fitted model object very quickly. The notebook also illustrates this procedure."

The test statistics of main effects and interactions are based on an orthogonal set of contrasts.

The following contrast specifiction returns estimates for the main effect of A, the main effect of B, and the interaction of A and B. In a figure With A on the x-axis and the levels of B shown as two lines, the interaction tests the null hypothesis that the two lines are parallel. A positive coefficient implies overadditivity (diverging lines toward the right) and a negative coefficient underadditivity (converging lines).\n\nm5 = let\n  contrasts = Dict(\n    :CTR =&gt; HypothesisCoding(\n      [\n        -1 -1 +1 +1          # A\n        -1 +1 -1 +1          # B\n        +1 -1 -1 +1          # A x B\n      ];\n      levels,\n      labels=[\"A\", \"B\", \"AxB\"],\n    ),\n  )\n  fit(MixedModel, form, dat1; contrasts)\nend\n\n\n\n\n\nEst.\nSE\nz\np\nσ_Subj\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n389.7336\n7.0912\n54.96\n&lt;1e-99\n55.1986\n\n\nCTR: A\n59.0052\n5.1827\n11.38\n&lt;1e-29\n36.2091\n\n\nCTR: B\n31.0348\n4.6750\n6.64\n&lt;1e-10\n31.7133\n\n\nCTR: AxB\n-36.5287\n3.0927\n-11.81\n&lt;1e-31\n16.0046\n\n\nResidual\n69.8348\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is also helpful to see the corresponding layout of the four means for the interaction of A and B (i.e., the third contrast)\n        B1     B2\n   A1   +1     -1\n   A2   -1     +1\nThus, interaction tests whether the difference between main diagonal and minor diagonal is different from zero.\n\n\n4.8.2 A(2) x B(2) x C(2)\nGoing beyond the four level factor; it is also helpful to see the corresponding layout of the eight means for the interaction of A and B and C.\n          C1              C2\n      B1     B2        B1     B2\n A1   +1     -1   A1   -1     +1\n A2   -1     +1   A2   +1     -1\n\n\n4.8.3 A(2) x B(2) x C(3)\nTO BE DONE"

    "text": "3 Generalized Linear Mixed Models\nConsider first a GLMM for a vector, \\(\\bf y\\), of binary (i.e. yes/no) responses. The probability model for the conditional distribution \\(\\mathcal Y|\\mathcal B=\\bf b\\) consists of independent Bernoulli distributions where the mean, \\(\\mu_i\\), for the i’th response is again determined by the i’th element of a linear predictor, \\(\\boldsymbol\\eta = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol\\beta+\\mathbf{Z b}\\).\nHowever, in this case we will run into trouble if we try to make \\(\\boldsymbol\\mu=\\boldsymbol\\eta\\) because \\(\\mu_i\\) is the probability of “success” for the i’th response and must be between 0 and 1. We can’t guarantee that the i’th component of \\(\\boldsymbol\\eta\\) will be between 0 and 1. To get around this problem we apply a transformation to take \\(\\eta_i\\) to \\(\\mu_i\\). For historical reasons this transformation is called the inverse link, written \\(g^{-1}\\), and the opposite transformation - from the probability scale to an unbounded scale - is called the link, g.\nEach probability distribution in the exponential family (which is most of the important ones), has a canonical link which comes from the form of the distribution itself. The details aren’t as important as recognizing that the distribution itself determines a preferred link function.\nFor the Bernoulli distribution, the canonical link is the logit or log-odds function, \\[\n\\eta = g(\\mu) = \\log\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{1-\\mu}\\right),\n\\] (it’s called log-odds because it is the logarithm of the odds ratio, \\(p/(1-p)\\)) and the canonical inverse link is the logistic \\[\n\\mu=g^{-1}(\\eta)=\\frac{1}{1+\\exp(-\\eta)}.\n\\] This is why fitting a binary response is sometimes called logistic regression.\nFor later use we define a Julia logistic function. See this presentation for more information than you could possible want to know on how Julia converts code like this to run on the processor.\n\nincrement(x) = x + one(x)\nlogistic(η) = inv(increment(exp(-η)))\n\nlogistic (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nTo reiterate, the probability model for a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) is \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(\\mathcal{Y} | \\mathcal{B}=\\bf{b}) &\\sim\\mathcal{D}(\\bf{g^{-1}(X\\boldsymbol\\beta + Z b)},\\phi)\\\\\\\\\n\\mathcal{B}&\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\bf{0},\\Sigma_{\\boldsymbol\\theta}) .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) is the distribution family (such as Bernoulli or Poisson), \\(g^{-1}\\) is the inverse link and \\(\\phi\\) is a scale parameter for \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) if it has one. The important cases of the Bernoulli and Poisson distributions don’t have a scale parameter - once you know the mean you know everything you need to know about the distribution.

Unfortunately, the version of the data to which I had access did not record what the centering value was.\nA data plot, drawn using lattice graphics in R, shows that the probability of contraception use is not linear in age - it is low for younger women, higher for women in the middle of the range (assumed to be women in late 20’s to early 30’s) and low again for older women (late 30’s to early 40’s in this survey).\nIf we fit a model with only the age term in the fixed effects, that term will not be significant. This doesn’t mean that there is no “age effect”, it only means that there is no significant linear effect for age.\n\n\nCode\ndraw(\n  data(\n    @transform(\n      contra,\n      :numuse = Int(:use == \"Y\"),\n      :urb = ifelse(:urban == \"Y\", \"Urban\", \"Rural\")\n    )\n  ) *\n  mapping(\n    :age =&gt; \"Centered age (yr)\",\n    :numuse =&gt; \"Frequency of contraception use\";\n    col=:urb,\n    color=:livch,\n  ) *\n  smooth();\n  figure=(; resolution=(800, 450)),\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Smoothed relative frequency of contraception use versus centered age for women in the 1989 Bangladesh Fertility Survey\n\n\n\n\n\ncontrasts = Dict(\n  :dist =&gt; Grouping(),\n  :urban =&gt; HelmertCoding(),\n  :livch =&gt; DummyCoding(), # default, but no harm in being explicit\n)\nnAGQ = 9\ndist = Bernoulli()\ngm1 = let\n  form = @formula(\n    use ~ 1 + age + abs2(age) + urban + livch + (1 | dist)\n  )\n  fit(MixedModel, form, contra, dist; nAGQ, contrasts)\nend\n\nMinimizing 184   Time: 0:00:00 ( 2.65 ms/it)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEst.\nSE\nz\np\nσ_dist\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-0.6871\n0.1686\n-4.08\n&lt;1e-04\n0.4786\n\n\nage\n0.0035\n0.0092\n0.38\n0.7024\n\n\n\nabs2(age)\n-0.0046\n0.0007\n-6.29\n&lt;1e-09\n\n\n\nurban: Y\n0.3484\n0.0600\n5.81\n&lt;1e-08\n\n\n\nlivch: 1\n0.8152\n0.1622\n5.02\n&lt;1e-06\n\n\n\nlivch: 2\n0.9165\n0.1851\n4.95\n&lt;1e-06\n\n\n\nlivch: 3+\n0.9154\n0.1858\n4.93\n&lt;1e-06\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the linear term for age is not significant but the quadratic term for age is highly significant. We usually retain the lower order term, even if it is not significant, if the higher order term is significant.\nNotice also that the parameter estimates for the treatment contrasts for livch are similar. Thus the distinction of 1, 2, or 3+ childen is not as important as the contrast between having any children and not having any. Those women who already have children are more likely to use artificial contraception.\nFurthermore, the women without children have a different probability vs age profile than the women with children. To allow for this we define a binary children factor and incorporate an age&children interaction.\n\nVarCorr(gm1)\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nVariance\nStd.Dev\n\n\n\n\ndist\n(Intercept)\n0.229090\n0.478634\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that there is no “residual” variance being estimated.

Nevertheless we see that the deviance is much lower in the model with age & children even though the 3 levels of livch have been collapsed into a single level of children. There is a substantial decrease in the deviance even though there are fewer parameters in model gm2 than in gm1. This decrease is because the flexibility of the model - its ability to model the behavior of the response - is being put to better use in gm2 than in gm1.\nAt present the calculation of the geomdof as sum(influence(m)) is not correctly defined in our code for a GLMM so we need to do some more work before we can examine those values.\n\n\n3.3 Using urban&dist as a grouping factor\nIt turns out that there can be more difference between urban and rural settings within the same political district than there is between districts.

    "text": "We take the kwdyz11.arrow dataset (Kliegl et al., 2010) from an experiment looking at three effects of visual cueing under four different cue-target relations (CTRs). Two horizontal rectangles are displayed above and below a central fixation point or they displayed in vertical orientation to the left and right of the fixation point. Subjects react to the onset of a small visual target occuring at one of the four ends of the two rectangles. The target is cued validly on 70% of trials by a brief flash of the corner of the rectangle at which it appears; it is cued invalidly at the three other locations 10% of the trials each.\nWe specify three contrasts for the four-level factor CTR that are derived from spatial, object-based, and attractor-like features of attention. They map onto sequential differences between appropriately ordered factor levels. At the level of fixed effects, there is the noteworthy result, that the attraction effect was estimated at 2 ms, that is clearly not significant. Nevertheless, there was a highly reliable variance component (VC) estimated for this effect. Moreover, the reliable individual differences in the attraction effect were negatively correlated with those in the spatial effect.\nUnfortunately, a few years after the publication, we determined that the reported LMM is actually singular and that the singularity is linked to a theoretically critical correlation parameter (CP) between the spatial effect and the attraction effect. Fortunately, there is also a larger dataset kkl15.arrow from a replication and extension of this study (Kliegl et al., 2015), analyzed with kkl15.jl notebook. The critical CP (along with other fixed effects and CPs) was replicated in this study.\nA more comprehensive analysis was reported in the parsimonious mixed-model paper (Bates et al., 2015). Data and R scripts are also available in R-package RePsychLing. In this and the complementary kkl15.jl scripts, we provide some corresponding analyses with MixedModels.jl."

    "text": "Julius Krumbiegel also has a great blog post with more details on Julia environments.\nJulia packages can be configured (in a file called Project.toml) on a per-project basis. The packaged sources and compiled versions are stored in a central location, e.g. ~/.julia/packages and ~/.julia/compiled on Linux systems, but the configuration of packages to be used can be local to a project. The Pkg package is used to modify the local project’s configuration. (An alternative is “package mode” in the read-eval-print-loop or REPL, which we will show at the summer school.) Start julia in the directory of the cloned SMLP2022 repository\n\nusing Pkg        # there's a package called 'Pkg' to manipulate package configs\nPkg.activate(\".\")# activate the current directory as the project\n\nIf you’ve recieved an environment from someone/somwhere else – such as this course repository – then you’ll need to first “instantiate” it (i.e., install all the dependencies).\n\nPkg.instantiate()# only needed the first time you work in a project\nPkg.update()     # get the latest package versions compatible with the project\n\n\nPkg.status()\n\nOccasionally the Pkg.status function call will give info about new versions being available but blocked by requirements of other packages. This is to be expected - the package system is large and the web of dependencies are complex. Generally the Julia package system is very good at resolving dependencies.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Belenky et al. (2003) reported effects of sleep deprivation across a 14-day study of 30-to-40-year old men and women holding commercial vehicle driving licenses. Their analyses are based on a subset of tasks and ratings from very large and comprehensive test and questionnaire battery (Balkin et al., 2000).\nInitially 66 subjects were assigned to one of four time-in-bed (TIB) groups with 9 hours (22:00-07:00) of sleep augmentation or 7 hours (24:00-07:00), 5 hours (02:00-07:00), and 3 hours (04:00-0:00) of sleep restrictions per night, respectively. The final sample comprised 56 subjects. The Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) measures simple reaction time to a visual stimulus, presented approximately 10 times ⁄ minute (interstimulus interval varied from 2 to 10 s in 2-s increments) for 10 min and implemented in a thumb-operated, hand-held device (Dinges & Powell, 1985).\n\n\nThe study comprised 2 training days (T1, T2), one day with baseline measures (B), seven days with sleep deprivation (E1 to E7), and four recovery days (R1 to R4). T1 and T2 were devoted to training on the performance tests and familiarization with study procedures. PVT baseline testing commenced on the morning of the third day (B) and testing continued for the duration of the study (E1–E7, R1–R3; no measures were taken on R4). Bed times during T, B, and R days were 8 hours (23:00-07:00).\n\n\n\nThe PVT (along with the Stanford Sleepiness Scale) was administered as a battery four times per day (09:00, 12:00, 15:00, and 21:00 h); the battery included other tests not reported here (see Balkin et al., 2000). The sleep latency test was administered at 09:40 and 15:30 h for all groups. Subjects in the 3- and 5-h TIB groups performed an additional battery at 00:00 h and 02:00 h to occupy their additional time awake. The PVT and SSS were administered in this battery; however, as data from the 00:00 and 02:00 h sessions were not common to all TIB groups, these data were not included in the statistical analyses reported in the paper.\n\n\n\nThe authors analyzed response speed, that is (1/RT)*1000 – completely warranted according to a Box-Cox check of the current data – with mixed-model ANOVAs using group as between- and day as within-subject factors. The ANOVA was followed up with simple tests of the design effects implemented over days for each of the four groups.\n\n\n\nThe current data distributed with the RData collection is attributed to the 3-hour TIB group, but the means do not agree at all with those reported for this group in (Belenky et al., 2003, fig. 3) where the 3-hour TIB group is also based on only 13 (not 18) subjects. Specifically, the current data show a much smaller slow-down of response speed across E1 to E7 and do not reflect the recovery during R1 to R3. The currrent data also cover only 10 not 11 days, but it looks like only R3 is missing. The closest match of the current means was with the average of the 3-hour and 7-hour TIB groups; if only males were included, this would amount to 18 subjects. (This conjecture is based only on visual inspection of graphs.)"
