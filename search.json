    "text": "Unlike R, Julia does not immediately expose a huge number of functions, but instead requires loading packages (whether from the standard library or from the broader package ecosystem) for a lot of relevant functionality for statistical analysis. There are technical reasons for this, such as the ease of using the Julia package system. One further motivation is that Julia is aimed at a broader “technical computing” audience (like MATLAB or perhaps Python) and less at a “statistical analysis” audience.\nThis has two important implications:\nThis notebook is not intended to be an exhaustive list of packages, but rather to highlight a few packages that I suspect will be particularly useful. Before getting onto the packages, I have one final hint: take advantage of how easy and first-class package management in Julia is. Having good package management makes reproducible analyses much easier and avoids breaking old analyses when you start a new one. The package-manager REPL mode (activated by typing ] at the julia&gt; prompt) is very useful."

(Confusingly, the function for reading and writing Arrow format files in R is called read_feather and write_feather, but the modern Arrow format is distinct from the older Feather format provided by the feather package.) This is the format that we store the example and test datasets in for MixedModels.jl.\nCSV.jl useful for reading comma-separated values, tab-separated values and basically everything handled by the read.csv and read.table family of functions in R.\n\nNote that by default both Arrow.jl and CSV.jl do not return a DataFrame, but rather “column tables” – named tuples of column vectors."

    "text": "1.2 DataFrames\nUnlike in R, DataFrames are not part of the base language, nor the standard library.\nDataFrames.jl provides the basic infrastructure around DataFrames, as well as its own mini language for doing the split-apply-combine approach that underlies R’s dplyr and much of the tidyverse. The DataFrames.jl documentation is the place for looking at how to e.g. read in a CSV or Arrow file as a DataFrame. Note that DataFrames.jl by default depends on CategoricalArrays.jl to handle the equivalent of factor in the R world, but there is an alternative package for factor-like array type in Julia, PooledArrays.jl. PooledArrays are simpler, but more limited than CategoricalArrays and we (Phillip and Doug) sometimes use them in our examples and simulations. The tables produced by reading an Arrow file have their own representation of factor-like data as DictEncoded arrays.\nDataFrame.jl’s mini language can be a bit daunting, if you’re used to manipulations in the style of base R or the tidyverse. For that, there are several options; recently, we’e had particularly nice experiences with DataFrameMacros.jl and Chain.jl for a convenient syntax to connect or “pipe” together successive operations. It’s your choice whether and which of these add-ons you want to use! Phillip tends to write his code using raw DataFrames.jl, but Doug really enjoys DataFrameMacros.jl.\nThe recently added Tidier collection of Julia packages is popular with those coming from the tidyverse."

The same is true for GLM.jl, which provides basic linear and generalized linear models, such as ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and logistic regression, i.e. the classical, non mixed regression models.\nThe basic functionality looks quite similar to R, e.g.\njulia &gt; lm(@formula(y ~ 1 + x), data)\njulia &gt; glm(@formula(y ~ 1 + x), data, Binomial(), LogitLink())\nbut the more general modelling API (also used by MixedModels.jl) is also supported:\njulia &gt; fit(LinearModel, @formula(y ~ 1 + x), mydata)\njulia &gt; fit(\n  GeneralizedLinearModel,\n  @formula(y ~ 1 + x),\n  data,\n  Binomial(),\n  LogitLink(),\n)\n(You can also specify your model matrices directly and skip the formula interface, but we don’t recommend this as it’s easy to mess up in really subtle but very problematic ways.)"

This is also why macros are used by packages like Turing.jl and Soss.jl that define a language for Bayesian probabilistic programming like PyMC3 or Stan."

StandardizedPredictors.jl provides functions for centering, scaling, and z-scoring within the formula.

The parameter estimates are about 250 ms. typical reaction time without deprivation and a typical increase of 10.5 ms. per day of sleep deprivation.\nThe random effects represent shifts from the typical behavior for each subject. The shift in the intercept has a standard deviation of about 24 ms. which would suggest a range of about 200 ms. to 300 ms. in the intercepts. Similarly within-subject slopes would be expected to have a range of about 0 ms./day up to 20 ms./day.\nThe random effects for the slope and for the intercept are allowed to be correlated within subject. The estimated correlation, 0.08, is small. This estimate is not shown in the default display above but is shown in the output from VarCorr (variance components and correlations).\n\nVarCorr(m1)\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nVariance\nStd.Dev\nCorr.\n\n\n\n\nsubj\n(Intercept)\n565.51066\n23.78047\n\n\n\n\ndays\n32.68212\n5.71683\n+0.08\n\n\nResidual\n\n654.94145\n25.59182\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnically, the random effects for each subject are unobserved random variables and are not “parameters” in the model per se. Hence we do not report standard errors or confidence intervals for these deviations. However, we can produce prediction intervals on the random effects for each subject. Because the experimental design is balanced, these intervals will have the same width for all subjects.\nA plot of the prediction intervals versus the level of the grouping factor (subj, in this case) is sometimes called a caterpillar plot because it can look like a fuzzy caterpillar if there are many levels of the grouping factor.

For example, in m2 there are two fixed-effects parameters and three variance components (including the residual variance).\nAn alternative, more geometrically inspired definition of “degrees of freedom”, is the sum of the leverage values, called geomdof in this table.\nInterestingly, the model with fewer parameters, m2, has a greater sum of the leverage values than the model with more parameters, m1. We’re not sure what to make of that.\nIn both cases the sum of the leverage values is toward the upper end of the range of possible values, which is the rank of the fixed-effects model matrix (2) up to the rank of the fixed-effects plus the random effects model matrix (2 + 36 = 38).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI think that the upper bound may be 36, not 38, because the two columns of X lie in the column span of Z\n\n\nThis comparison does show, however, that a simple count of the parameters in a mixed-effects model can underestimate, sometimes drastically, the model complexity. This is because a single variance component or multiple components can add many dimensions to the linear predictor.\n\n\n4 Some diagnostic plots\nIn mixed-effects models the linear predictor expression incorporates fixed-effects parameters, which summarize trends for the population or certain well-defined subpopulations, and random effects which represent deviations associated with the experimental units or observational units - individual subjects, in this case. The random effects are modeled as unobserved random variables.\nThe conditional means of these random variables, sometimes called the BLUPs or Best Linear Unbiased Predictors, are not simply the least squares estimates. They are attenuated or shrunk towards zero to reflect the fact that the individuals are assumed to come from a population. A shrinkage plot, Figure 3, shows the BLUPs from the model fit compared to the values without any shrinkage. If the BLUPs are similar to the unshrunk values then the more complicated model accounting for individual differences is supported. If the BLUPs are strongly shrunk towards zero then the additional complexity in the model to account for individual differences is not providing sufficient increase in fidelity to the data to warrant inclusion.\n\n\nCode\nshrinkageplot!(Figure(; resolution=(500, 500)), m1)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Shrinkage plot of means of the random effects in model m1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis plot could be drawn as shrinkageplot(m1). The reason for explicitly creating a Figure to be modified by shrinkageplot! is to control the resolution.\n\n\nThis plot shows an intermediate pattern. The random effects are somewhat shrunk toward the origin, a model simplification trend, but not completely shrunk - indicating that fidelity to the data is enhanced with these additional coefficients in the linear predictor.\nIf the shrinkage were primarily in one direction - for example, if the arrows from the unshrunk values to the shrunk values were mostly in the vertical direction - then we would get an indication that we could drop the random effect for slope and revert to a simpler model. This is not the case here.\nAs would be expected, the unshrunk values that are further from the origin tend to be shrunk more toward the origin. That is, the arrows that originate furthest from the origin are longer. However, that is not always the case. The arrow in the upper right corner, from S337, is relatively short. Examination of the panel for S337 in the data plot shows a strong linear trend, even though both the intercept and the slope are unusually large. The neighboring panels in the data plot, S330 and S331, have more variability around the least squares line and are subject to a greater amount of shrinkage in the model.

A parametric bootstrap sample for model m is a collection of models of the same form as m fit to data values simulated from m. That is, we pretend that m and its parameter values are the true parameter values, simulate data from these values, and estimate parameters from the simulated data.\nSimulating and fitting a substantial number of model fits, 5000 in this case, takes only a few seconds, following which we extract a data frame of the parameter estimates and plot densities of some of these estimates.\n\nrng = Random.seed!(42)    # initialize a random number generator\nm1bstp = parametricbootstrap(rng, 5000, m1)\ntbl = m1bstp.tbl\n\nTable with 10 columns and 5000 rows:\n      obj      β1       β2       σ        σ1       σ2       ρ1          ⋯\n    ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n 1  │ 1717.29  260.712  9.84975  23.4092  15.3314  6.40292  -0.0259483  ⋯\n 2  │ 1744.06  262.253  12.3008  25.7047  16.3183  5.54687  0.552609    ⋯\n 3  │ 1714.16  253.149  12.879   22.2753  25.4787  6.1444   0.0691544   ⋯\n 4  │ 1711.54  263.376  11.5798  23.3128  18.8039  4.65569  0.103361    ⋯\n 5  │ 1741.66  248.429  9.39444  25.4355  20.1412  5.27358  -0.163606   ⋯\n 6  │ 1754.81  256.794  8.024    26.5089  10.6769  7.14153  0.335544    ⋯\n 7  │ 1777.73  253.388  8.83556  27.8623  17.8322  7.17385  0.00379492  ⋯\n 8  │ 1768.59  254.441  11.4479  27.4034  16.2487  6.67041  0.725384    ⋯\n 9  │ 1753.56  244.906  11.3423  25.6046  25.3607  5.98654  -0.171821   ⋯\n 10 │ 1722.61  257.088  9.18397  23.3386  24.9274  5.18012  0.181143    ⋯\n 11 │ 1738.16  251.262  11.6568  25.7823  17.6665  4.07214  0.258136    ⋯\n 12 │ 1747.76  258.302  12.8015  26.1085  19.2398  5.06067  0.879704    ⋯\n 13 │ 1745.91  254.57   11.8062  24.8863  24.2513  6.14642  0.0126995   ⋯\n 14 │ 1738.8   251.179  10.3226  24.2672  23.7195  6.32645  0.368592    ⋯\n 15 │ 1724.76  238.603  11.5045  25.2301  19.026   3.64035  -0.346558   ⋯\n 16 │ 1777.7   254.133  8.26397  26.9846  26.3715  7.8283   -0.288773   ⋯\n 17 │ 1748.33  251.571  9.5294   26.2927  21.9611  4.31316  -0.150104   ⋯\n 18 │ 1708.99  245.607  12.8175  24.4135  12.494   5.11304  -0.694452   ⋯\n 19 │ 1732.8   256.87   12.2719  23.9952  20.2663  6.58464  0.147647    ⋯\n 20 │ 1746.12  247.428  10.4695  24.319   32.9351  5.78109  0.0337611   ⋯\n 21 │ 1788.6   254.067  9.11893  27.8716  29.9888  6.74499  -0.0317739  ⋯\n 22 │ 1772.12  245.629  10.4063  28.3482  17.6055  5.14085  -0.0573809  ⋯\n 23 │ 1749.18  245.683  11.673   25.3641  26.4956  5.18958  0.469144    ⋯\n ⋮  │    ⋮        ⋮        ⋮        ⋮        ⋮        ⋮         ⋮       ⋱\n\n\nAn empirical density plot of the estimates for the fixed-effects coefficients, Figure 4, shows the normal distribution, “bell-curve”, shape as we might expect.\n\n\nCode\nbegin\n  f1 = Figure(; resolution=(1000, 400))\n  CairoMakie.density!(\n    Axis(f1[1, 1]; xlabel=\"Intercept [ms]\"), tbl.β1\n  )\n  CairoMakie.density!(\n    Axis(f1[1, 2]; xlabel=\"Coefficient of days [ms/day]\"),\n    tbl.β2\n  )\n  f1\nend\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Empirical density plots of bootstrap replications of fixed-effects parameter estimates\n\n\n\n\nIt is also possible to create interval estimates of the parameters from the bootstrap replicates.

    "text": "3 How to interpret a shrinkage plot\n\nExtreme shrinkage (shrunk to a line or to a point) is easy to interpret - the term is not providing benefit and can be removed.\nWhen the range of the blue dots (shrunk values) is comparable to those of the red dots (unshrunk) it indicates that the term after shrinkage is about as strong as without shrinkage.\nBy itself, this doesn’t mean that the term is important. In some ways you need to get a feeling for the absolute magnitude of the random effects in addition to the relative magnitude.\nSmall magnitude and small relative magnitude indicate you can drop that term"

    "text": "Statistical methods that are based on probability models can be used to provide us with a “best guess” of the value of parameters, such as the effect of a particular experimental treatment, in the form of a parameter estimate. In addition, the probability model can be used to assess the uncertainty in the estimate.\nOften the information about the uncertainty is reduced to a single number, a p-value for a test of a null hypothesis, such as the effect being zero, versus the alternative of a non-zero effect. But quoting a single number from a model fit to experimental data, which may have required considerable effort and expense to obtain, will often mean discarding a considerable amount of the information in the data. In the days when computing was expensive and labor-intensive this may have been unavoidable. However, modern computing hardware and software systems provide us with the opportunity of much more intensive evaluation of the uncertainty. At a minimum, instead of focussing solely on the question of whether a coefficient could reasonably be zero, we can formulate confidence intervals on individual parameter estimates or confidence regions on groups of parameters.\nWe have seen the used of a parametric bootstrap to create a sample from the distribution of the estimators of the parameters, and how such samples can be used to create coverage intervals. The bootstrap is based on simulating response vectors from the model that has been fit to the observed data and refitting the same model to these simulated responses.\nIn this section we explore another approach based on refitting the model, keeping the same responses but holding one of the parameters fixed at a specified value.\n\n\nLoad the packages to be used\n\n\nCode\nusing AlgebraOfGraphics\nusing CairoMakie\nusing MixedModels\nusing MixedModelsMakie\nusing Random\nusing SMLP2023: dataset\n\nCairoMakie.activate!(; type=\"svg\")\nimport ProgressMeter\nProgressMeter.ijulia_behavior(:clear)\n\n\nLoad the data and define the contrasts so that the coefficients for each of the experimental variables, load, spkr and prec, are positive.\n\ncontrasts = Dict( # base levels so estimates for speed are positive\n  :load =&gt; EffectsCoding(; base=\"yes\"),\n  :prec =&gt; EffectsCoding(; base=\"break\"),\n  :spkr =&gt; EffectsCoding(; base=\"old\"),\n)\nkb07 = Table(dataset(:kb07))\n\nTable with 7 columns and 1789 rows:\n      subj  item  spkr  prec      load  rt_trunc  rt_raw\n    ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────\n 1  │ S030  I01   new   break     yes   2267      2267\n 2  │ S030  I02   old   maintain  no    3856      3856\n 3  │ S030  I03   old   break     no    1567      1567\n 4  │ S030  I04   new   maintain  no    1732      1732\n 5  │ S030  I05   new   break     no    2660      2660\n 6  │ S030  I06   old   maintain  yes   2763      2763\n 7  │ S030  I07   old   break     yes   3528      3528\n 8  │ S030  I08   new   maintain  yes   1741      1741\n 9  │ S030  I09   new   break     yes   3692      3692\n 10 │ S030  I10   old   maintain  no    1949      1949\n 11 │ S030  I11   old   break     no    2189      2189\n 12 │ S030  I12   new   maintain  no    2207      2207\n 13 │ S030  I13   new   break     no    2078      2078\n 14 │ S030  I14   old   maintain  yes   1901      1901\n 15 │ S030  I15   old   break     yes   4015      4015\n 16 │ S030  I16   new   maintain  yes   1880      1880\n 17 │ S030  I17   new   break     yes   1444      1444\n 18 │ S030  I18   old   maintain  no    1683      1683\n 19 │ S030  I19   old   break     no    2037      2037\n 20 │ S030  I20   new   maintain  no    1168      1168\n 21 │ S030  I21   new   break     no    1930      1930\n 22 │ S030  I22   old   maintain  yes   1843      1843\n 23 │ S030  I23   old   break     yes   4969      4969\n ⋮  │  ⋮     ⋮     ⋮       ⋮       ⋮       ⋮        ⋮\n\n\nNow we fit and profile a model.

The change in the objective when we constrain one parameter to a particular value has approximately a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution on 1 degree of freedom, which is the square of a standard normal distribution, \\(\\mathcal{Z}^2\\). We can convert this change in the quality of the fit to the scale of the standard normal distribution by taking the signed square root, which is the square root of the change in the objective with the sign of \\(\\psi-\\hat{\\psi}\\) where \\(\\psi\\) represents the parameter being profiled. This is the value labelled \\(\\zeta\\) in the table.\nTo review:\n\nEach row in the table is the result of re-fitting the original model with the parameter in the p column held fixed at a particular value, as shown in the column for that parameter.\nThe \\(\\zeta\\) column is the signed square root of the change in the objective from the global parameter estimates.\nThus in the block of rows where \\(\\sigma\\) is held fixed, the \\(\\zeta\\) values in rows for which \\(\\sigma&lt;\\hat\\sigma\\) are negative and those for which \\(\\sigma &gt; \\hat\\sigma\\) have positive values of \\(\\zeta\\).\nRows in which \\(\\zeta=0.0\\) are the global parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows, for each of the fixed effects parameters, \\(\\zeta\\) versus the parameter value.\n\n\nCode\nzetaplot!(Figure(; resolution=(1200, 350)), pr01; ptyp='β')\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: ζ versus the value of the coefficient for the fixed-effects parameters in a model of response speed for the kb07 data.\n\n\n\n\nThe lines on these panels are read like normal probability plots, i.e. QQ plots against a standard normal distribution. Those on the \\(\\beta_2\\) and \\(\\beta_3\\) panels are, to the resolution of the plot, straight lines which indicates that the estimators of those parameters are normally distributed over the region of interest.\nThe points in the \\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\beta_4\\) panels are slightly over-dispersed relative to the straight line, which means that the estimators of these parameters are distributed like a T-distribution with a moderate number of degrees of freedom.\nThe profile-\\(\\zeta\\) function can be used to generate confidence intervals on the parameters\n\nconfint(pr01)\n\nDictTable with 3 columns and 8 rows:\n par   estimate   lower       upper\n ────┬─────────────────────────────────\n β1  │ 0.531523   0.497103    0.565942\n β2  │ 0.0212959  0.0148295   0.0277621\n β3  │ 0.011218   0.00475175  0.0176844\n β4  │ 0.0698293  0.0523046   0.0873562\n σ   │ 0.139458   0.13486     0.144322\n σ1  │ 0.0781364  0.0612443   0.103257\n σ2  │ 0.0452502  0.0338521   0.0618819\n σ3  │ 0.0736113  0.0600844   0.0916852\n\n\nas shown in Figure 2, which shows the absolute value of \\(\\zeta\\), which is simply the square root of the difference in the objective, versus the parameter being profiled.\n\n\nCode\nzetaplot!(Figure(; resolution=(1200, 330)), pr01; ptyp='β', absv=true)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Absolute value of ζ versus value of the coefficient for the fixed-effects parameters in a model of response speed for the kb07 data.

    "section": "2.1 Response, covariates, and factors",
    "text": "2.1 Response, covariates, and factors\nLinear mixed models (LMMs), like many other types of statistical models, describe a relationship between a response variable and covariates that have been measured or observed along with the response. The statistical model assumes that the residuals of the fitted response (i.e., not the responses) are normally – also identically and independently – distributed. This is the first assumption of normality in the LMM. It is standard practice that model residuals are inspected and, if serious skew is indicated, that the response is Box-Cox transformed (unless not justified for theoretical reasons) to fulfill this model assumption.\nIn the following we distinguish between categorical covariates and numerical covariates. Categorical covariates are factors. The important characteristic of a factor is that, for each observed value of the response, the factor takes on the value of one of a set of discrete levels. The levels can be unordered (nominal) or ordered (ordinal). We use the term covariate when we refer to numerical covariates, that is to continuous measures with some distribution. In principle, statistical models are not constrained by the distribution of observations across levels of factors and covariates, but the distribution may lead to problems of model identification and it does implications for statistical power.\nStatistical power, especially for the detection of interactions, is best when observations are uniformly distributed across levels of factors or uniform across the values of covariates. In experimental designs, uniform distributions may be achieved by balanced assignment of subjects (or other carriers of responses) to the levels of factors or combinations of factor levels. In observational contexts, we achieve uniform distributions by stratification (e..g., on age, gender, or IQ scores). Statistical power is worse for skewed than normal distributions (I think …). Therefore, although it is not required to meet an assumption of the statistical model, it may be useful to consider Box-Cox transformations of covariates."

    "text": "2.2 Nested and crossed random (grouping) factors\nIn LMMs the levels of at least one of the factors represents units in the data set that are assumed to be sampled, ideally randomly, from a population that is normally distributed with respect to the response. This is the second assumption of normal distribution in LMMs. In psychology and linguistics the observational units are often the subjects or items (e..g., texts, sentences, words, pictures) in the study. We may use numbers, such as subject identifiers, to designate the particular levels that we observed; we recommend to prepend these numbers with “S” or “I” to avoid confusion with numeric variables.\nRandom sampling is the basis of generalization from the sample to the population. The core statistics we will estimate in this context are variances and correlations of grand means and (quasi-)experimental effects. These terms will be explained below. What we want to stress here is that the estimation of (co-)variances / correlations requires a larger number of units (levels) than the estimation of means. Therefore, from a practical perspective, it is important that random factors are represented with many units.\nWhen there is more than one random factor, we must be clear about their relation. The two prototypical cases are that the factors are nested or crossed. In multilevel models, a special case of mixed models, the levels of the random factors are strictly nested. For example, at a given time, every student attends a specific class in a specific school. Students, classes, and schools could be three random factors. As soon as we look at this scenario across several school years, the nesting quickly falls apart because students may move between classes and between schools.\nIn psychology and linguistics, random factors are often crossed, for example, when every subject reads every word in every sentence in a word-by-word self-paced reading experiment (or alternatively: when every word in every sentence elicits a response from every subject). However, in an eye-movement experiment (for example), the perfect crossing on a measure like fixation duration is not attainable because of blinks or skipping of words.\nIn summary, the typical situation in experimental and observational studies with more than one random factor is partial crossing or partial nesting of levels of the random factors. Linear mixed models handle these situations very well."

    "text": "2.4 Between-unit and within-unit factors / covariates\nThe distinction between between-unit and within-unit factors is always relative to a random (grouping) factor of an experimental design. A between-unit factor / covariate is a factor for which every unit of the random factor is assigned to or characterized by only one level of the factor. A within-unit factor is a factor for which units of the random factor appear at every level of the factor.\nFor the typical random factor, say Subject, there is little ambiguity because we are used to the between-within distinction from ANOVAs, more specifically the F1-ANOVA. In psycholinguistics, there is the tradition to test effects also for the second random factor Item in an F2-ANOVA. Importantly, for a given fixed factor all four combinations are possible. For example, Gender is a fixed quasi-experimental between-subject / within-item factor; word frequency is a fixed quasi-experimental within-subject / between-item covariate; Prime-target relation is a fixed experimental within-subject / within-item factor (assuming that targets are presented both in a primed and in an unprimed situation); and when a training manipulation is defined by the items used in the training, then in a training-control group design, the fixed factor Group is a fixed experimental between-subject / between-item factor.\nThese distinctions are critical for setting up LMMs because variance components for (quasi-)experimental effects can only be specified for within-unit effects. Note also that loss of data (within limits), counterbalancing or blocking of items are irrelevant for these definitions."

(If we don’t do it, the program chooses DummyCoding contrasts for us.)\nThe simplest specification of a covariate is to include its linear trend, that is its slope.

Fixed-effect model parameters estimate the hypothesized main and interaction effects of the study. The estimates of factors are based on contrasts; the estimates of covariates are based on trends. Conceptually, they correspond to unstandardized regression coefficients in multiple regression.\nThe intercept is a special regression coefficient; it estimates the value of the dependent variable when all fixed effects associated with factors and trends associated with covariates are zero. In experimental designs with higher-order interactions there is an advantage of specifying the LMM in such a way that the intercept estimates the grand mean (GM; mean of the means of design cells). This happens if (a) contrasts for factors are chosen such that the intercept estimates the GM (positive: EffectsCoding, SeqDifferenceCoding, or HelmertCoding contrasts; negative: DummyCoding), (b) orthogonal polynomial trends are used (Helmert, anova-based), and (c) covariates are centered on their mean before inclusion in the model. As always, there may be good theoretical reasons to depart from the default recommendation.\nThe specification of contrasts / trends does not depend on the status of the fixed factor / covariate.

    "text": "2.7 Variance components (VCs) and correlation parameters (CPs)\nVariance components (VCs) and correlation parameters (CPs) are within-group model parameters; they correspond to (some of the) within-unit (quasi-)experimental fixed-effect model parameters. Thus, we may be able to estimate a subject-related VC for word frequency. If we included a linear trend for word frequency, the VC estimates the subject-related variance in these slopes. We cannot estimate an item-related VC for the word-frequency slopes because there is only one frequency associated with words. Analogously, we may able to estimate an item-related VC for the effect of Group (training vs. control), but we cannot estimate a subject-related VC for this effect.\nThe within-between characteristics of fixed factors and covariates relative to the random factor(s) are features of the design of the experiment or observational study. They fundamentally constrain the specification of the LMM. That’s why it is of upmost importance to be absolutely clear about their status."

They are not needed for model specification or model selection.\nThe VC is the prior variance of the random effects, whereas var(ranef(model)) is the variance of the posterior means/modes of the random effects.

It is a direct replication of an experiment reported in Masson & Kliegl (2013, Exp. 1, JEPLMC). Following a prime word a related or unrelated high- or low-frequency target word or a nonword was presented in clear or dim font. The subject’s task was to decide as quickly as possible whether the target was a word or a nonword, that is subjects performed a lexical decision task (LDT). The reaction time and the accuracy of the response were recorded. Only correct reaction times to words are included. After filtering there were 16,409 observations recorded from 73 subjects and 240 items."

    "text": "We take the kwdyz11 dataset (Kliegl et al., 2011) from an experiment looking at three effects of visual cueing under four different cue-target relations (CTRs). Two horizontal rectangles are displayed above and below a central fixation point or they displayed in vertical orientation to the left and right of the fixation point. Subjects react to the onset of a small visual target occurring at one of the four ends of the two rectangles. The target is cued validly on 70% of trials by a brief flash of the corner of the rectangle at which it appears; it is cued invalidly at the three other locations 10% of the trials each.\nWe specify three contrasts for the four-level factor CTR that are derived from spatial, object-based, and attractor-like features of attention. They map onto sequential differences between appropriately ordered factor levels. At the level of fixed effects, there is the noteworthy result, that the attraction effect was estimated at 2 ms, that is clearly not significant. Nevertheless, there was a highly reliable variance component (VC) estimated for this effect. Moreover, the reliable individual differences in the attraction effect were negatively correlated with those in the spatial effect.\nUnfortunately, a few years after the publication, we determined that the reported LMM is actually singular and that the singularity is linked to a theoretically critical correlation parameter (CP) between the spatial effect and the attraction effect. Fortunately, there is also a larger dataset kkl15 from a replication and extension of this study (Kliegl et al., 2015), analyzed with kkl15.jl notebook. The critical CP (along with other fixed effects and CPs) was replicated in this study.\nA more comprehensive analysis was reported in the parsimonious mixed-model paper (Bates et al., 2015). Data and R scripts are also available in R-package RePsychLing. In this and the complementary kkl15.jl scripts, we provide some corresponding analyses with MixedModels.jl."

    "text": "3 Generalized Linear Mixed Models\nConsider first a GLMM for a vector, \\(\\bf y\\), of binary (i.e. yes/no) responses. The probability model for the conditional distribution \\(\\mathcal Y|\\mathcal B=\\bf b\\) consists of independent Bernoulli distributions where the mean, \\(\\mu_i\\), for the i’th response is again determined by the i’th element of a linear predictor, \\(\\boldsymbol\\eta = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol\\beta+\\mathbf{Z b}\\).\nHowever, in this case we will run into trouble if we try to make \\(\\boldsymbol\\mu=\\boldsymbol\\eta\\) because \\(\\mu_i\\) is the probability of “success” for the i’th response and must be between 0 and 1. We can’t guarantee that the i’th component of \\(\\boldsymbol\\eta\\) will be between 0 and 1. To get around this problem we apply a transformation to take \\(\\eta_i\\) to \\(\\mu_i\\). For historical reasons this transformation is called the inverse link, written \\(g^{-1}\\), and the opposite transformation - from the probability scale to an unbounded scale - is called the link, g.\nEach probability distribution in the exponential family (which is most of the important ones), has a canonical link which comes from the form of the distribution itself. The details aren’t as important as recognizing that the distribution itself determines a preferred link function.\nFor the Bernoulli distribution, the canonical link is the logit or log-odds function, \\[\n\\eta = g(\\mu) = \\log\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{1-\\mu}\\right),\n\\] (it’s called log-odds because it is the logarithm of the odds ratio, \\(p/(1-p)\\)) and the canonical inverse link is the logistic \\[\n\\mu=g^{-1}(\\eta)=\\frac{1}{1+\\exp(-\\eta)}.\n\\] This is why fitting a binary response is sometimes called logistic regression.\nFor later use we define a Julia logistic function.

Unfortunately, the version of the data to which I had access did not record what the centering value was.\nA data plot, Figure 1, shows that the probability of contraception use is not linear in age - it is low for younger women, higher for women in the middle of the range (assumed to be women in late 20’s to early 30’s) and low again for older women (late 30’s to early 40’s in this survey).\nIf we fit a model with only the age term in the fixed effects, that term will not be significant.

We usually retain the lower order term, even if it is not significant, if the higher order term is significant.\nNotice also that the parameter estimates for the treatment contrasts for livch are similar. Thus the distinction of 1, 2, or 3+ children is not as important as the contrast between having any children and not having any. Those women who already have children are more likely to use artificial contraception.\nFurthermore, the women without children have a different probability vs age profile than the women with children. To allow for this we define a binary children factor and incorporate an age&children interaction.\n\nVarCorr(gm1)\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nVariance\nStd.Dev\n\n\n\n\ndist\n(Intercept)\n0.229113\n0.478657\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that there is no “residual” variance being estimated.

Nevertheless we see that the deviance is much lower in the model with age & children even though the 3 levels of livch have been collapsed into a single level of children. There is a substantial decrease in the deviance even though there are fewer parameters in model gm2 than in gm1. This decrease is because the flexibility of the model - its ability to model the behavior of the response - is being put to better use in gm2 than in gm1.\nAt present the calculation of the geomdof as sum(influence(m)) is not correctly defined in our code for a GLMM so we need to do some more work before we can examine those values.\n\n\n3.3 Using urban&dist as a grouping factor\nIt turns out that there can be more difference between urban and rural settings within the same political district than there is between districts.

    "text": "1 The Arrow storage format\nThe Arrow storage format provides a language-agnostic storage and memory specification for columnar data tables, which just means “something that looks like a data frame in R”. That is, an arrow table is an ordered, named collection of columns, all of the same length.\nThe columns can be of different types including numeric values, character strings, and factor-like representations - called DictEncoded.\nAn Arrow file can be read or written from R, Python, Julia and many other languages. Somewhat confusingly in R and Python the name feather, which refers to an earlier version of the storage format, is used in some function names like read_feather.\nInternally, the SMLP2023 package uses Arrow to store all of its datasets.\n\n\n2 The Emotikon data\nThe SMLP2021 repository contains a version of the data from Fühner et al. (2021) in notebooks/data/fggk21.arrow. After that file was created there were changes in the master RDS file on the osf.io site for the project. We will recreate the Arrow file here then split it into two separate tables, one with a row for each child in the study and one with a row for each test result.\nThe Arrow package for Julia does not export any function names, which means that the function to read an Arrow file must be called as Arrow.Table. It returns a column table, as described in the Tables package. This is like a read-only data frame, which can be easily converted to a full-fledged DataFrame if desired.\nThis arrangement allows for the Arrow package not to depend on the DataFrames package, which is a heavy-weight dependency, but still easily produce a DataFrame if warranted.\nLoad the packages to be used.\n\n\nCode\nusing AlgebraOfGraphics\nusing Arrow\nusing CairoMakie\nusing Chain\nusing DataFrameMacros\nusing DataFrames\nusing Downloads\nusing KernelDensity\nusing RCall   # access R from within Julia\nusing StatsBase\n\nCairoMakie.activate!(; type=\"svg\")\nusing AlgebraOfGraphics: density\n\n\n\n\n3 Downloading and importing the RDS file\nThis is similar to some of the code shown by Julius Krumbiegel on Monday. In the data directory of the emotikon project on osf.io under Data, the url for the rds data file is found to be [https://osf.io/xawdb/]. Note that we want version 2 of this file.\n\nfn = Downloads.download(\"https://osf.io/xawdb/download?version=2\");\n\n\ndfrm = rcopy(R\"readRDS($fn)\")\n\n525126×7 DataFrame525101 rows omitted\n\n\n\nRow\nCohort\nSchool\nChild\nSex\nage\nTest\nscore\n\n\n\nCat…\nCat…\nCat…\nCat…\nFloat64\nCat…\nFloat64\n\n\n\n\n1\n2013\nS100067\nC002352\nmale\n7.99452\nS20_r\n5.26316\n\n\n2\n2013\nS100067\nC002352\nmale\n7.99452\nBPT\n3.7\n\n\n3\n2013\nS100067\nC002352\nmale\n7.99452\nSLJ\n125.0\n\n\n4\n2013\nS100067\nC002352\nmale\n7.99452\nStar_r\n2.47146\n\n\n5\n2013\nS100067\nC002352\nmale\n7.99452\nRun\n1053.0\n\n\n6\n2013\nS100067\nC002353\nmale\n7.99452\nS20_r\n5.0\n\n\n7\n2013\nS100067\nC002353\nmale\n7.99452\nBPT\n4.1\n\n\n8\n2013\nS100067\nC002353\nmale\n7.99452\nSLJ\n116.0\n\n\n9\n2013\nS100067\nC002353\nmale\n7.99452\nStar_r\n1.76778\n\n\n10\n2013\nS100067\nC002353\nmale\n7.99452\nRun\n1089.0\n\n\n11\n2013\nS100067\nC002354\nmale\n7.99452\nS20_r\n4.54545\n\n\n12\n2013\nS100067\nC002354\nmale\n7.99452\nBPT\n3.9\n\n\n13\n2013\nS100067\nC002354\nmale\n7.99452\nSLJ\n111.0\n\n\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n\n\n525115\n2018\nS401470\nC117964\nmale\n9.10609\nStar_r\n1.63704\n\n\n525116\n2018\nS401470\nC117964\nmale\n9.10609\nRun\n864.0\n\n\n525117\n2018\nS401470\nC117965\nfemale\n9.10609\nS20_r\n4.65116\n\n\n525118\n2018\nS401470\nC117965\nfemale\n9.10609\nBPT\n3.8\n\n\n525119\n2018\nS401470\nC117965\nfemale\n9.10609\nSLJ\n123.0\n\n\n525120\n2018\nS401470\nC117965\nfemale\n9.10609\nStar_r\n1.52889\n\n\n525121\n2018\nS401470\nC117965\nfemale\n9.10609\nRun\n1080.0\n\n\n525122\n2018\nS800200\nC117966\nmale\n9.10609\nS20_r\n4.54545\n\n\n525123\n2018\nS800200\nC117966\nmale\n9.10609\nBPT\n3.8\n\n\n525124\n2018\nS800200\nC117966\nmale\n9.10609\nSLJ\n100.0\n\n\n525125\n2018\nS800200\nC117966\nmale\n9.10609\nStar_r\n2.18506\n\n\n525126\n2018\nS800200\nC117966\nmale\n9.10609\nRun\n990.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow write this file as a Arrow file and read it back in.\n\narrowfn = joinpath(\"data\", \"fggk21.arrow\")\nArrow.write(arrowfn, dfrm; compress=:lz4)\ntbl = Arrow.Table(arrowfn)\n\nArrow.Table with 525126 rows, 7 columns, and schema:\n :Cohort  String\n :School  String\n :Child   String\n :Sex     String\n :age     Float64\n :Test    String\n :score   Float64\n\n\n\nfilesize(arrowfn)\n\n3077850\n\n\n\ndf = DataFrame(tbl)\n\n525126×7 DataFrame525101 rows omitted\n\n\n\nRow\nCohort\nSchool\nChild\nSex\nage\nTest\nscore\n\n\n\nString\nString\nString\nString\nFloat64\nString\nFloat64\n\n\n\n\n1\n2013\nS100067\nC002352\nmale\n7.99452\nS20_r\n5.26316\n\n\n2\n2013\nS100067\nC002352\nmale\n7.99452\nBPT\n3.7\n\n\n3\n2013\nS100067\nC002352\nmale\n7.99452\nSLJ\n125.0\n\n\n4\n2013\nS100067\nC002352\nmale\n7.99452\nStar_r\n2.47146\n\n\n5\n2013\nS100067\nC002352\nmale\n7.99452\nRun\n1053.0\n\n\n6\n2013\nS100067\nC002353\nmale\n7.99452\nS20_r\n5.0\n\n\n7\n2013\nS100067\nC002353\nmale\n7.99452\nBPT\n4.1\n\n\n8\n2013\nS100067\nC002353\nmale\n7.99452\nSLJ\n116.0\n\n\n9\n2013\nS100067\nC002353\nmale\n7.99452\nStar_r\n1.76778\n\n\n10\n2013\nS100067\nC002353\nmale\n7.99452\nRun\n1089.0\n\n\n11\n2013\nS100067\nC002354\nmale\n7.99452\nS20_r\n4.54545\n\n\n12\n2013\nS100067\nC002354\nmale\n7.99452\nBPT\n3.9\n\n\n13\n2013\nS100067\nC002354\nmale\n7.99452\nSLJ\n111.0\n\n\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n\n\n525115\n2018\nS401470\nC117964\nmale\n9.10609\nStar_r\n1.63704\n\n\n525116\n2018\nS401470\nC117964\nmale\n9.10609\nRun\n864.0\n\n\n525117\n2018\nS401470\nC117965\nfemale\n9.10609\nS20_r\n4.65116\n\n\n525118\n2018\nS401470\nC117965\nfemale\n9.10609\nBPT\n3.8\n\n\n525119\n2018\nS401470\nC117965\nfemale\n9.10609\nSLJ\n123.0\n\n\n525120\n2018\nS401470\nC117965\nfemale\n9.10609\nStar_r\n1.52889\n\n\n525121\n2018\nS401470\nC117965\nfemale\n9.10609\nRun\n1080.0\n\n\n525122\n2018\nS800200\nC117966\nmale\n9.10609\nS20_r\n4.54545\n\n\n525123\n2018\nS800200\nC117966\nmale\n9.10609\nBPT\n3.8\n\n\n525124\n2018\nS800200\nC117966\nmale\n9.10609\nSLJ\n100.0\n\n\n525125\n2018\nS800200\nC117966\nmale\n9.10609\nStar_r\n2.18506\n\n\n525126\n2018\nS800200\nC117966\nmale\n9.10609\nRun\n990.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Avoiding needless repetition\nOne of the principles of relational database design is that information should not be repeated needlessly. Each row of df is determined by a combination of Child and Test, together producing a score, which can be converted to a zScore.\nThe other columns in the table, Cohort, School, age, and Sex, are properties of the Child.\nStoring these values redundantly in the full table takes up space but, more importantly, allows for inconsistency. As it stands, a given Child could be recorded as being in one Cohort for the Run test and in another Cohort for the S20_r test and nothing about the table would detect this as being an error.\nThe approach used in relational databases is to store the information for score in one table that contains only Child, Test and score, store the information for the Child in another table including Cohort, School, age and Sex. These tables can then be combined to create the table to be used for analysis by joining the different tables together.\nThe maintainers of the DataFrames package have put in a lot of work over the past few years to make joins quite efficient in Julia. Thus the processing penalty of reassembling the big table from three smaller tables is minimal.\nIt is important to note that the main advantage of using smaller tables that are joined together to produce the analysis table is the fact that the information in the analysis table is consistent by design.\n\n\n5 Creating the smaller table\n\nChild = unique(select(df, :Child, :School, :Cohort, :Sex, :age))\n\n108295×5 DataFrame108270 rows omitted\n\n\n\nRow\nChild\nSchool\nCohort\nSex\nage\n\n\n\nString\nString\nString\nString\nFloat64\n\n\n\n\n1\nC002352\nS100067\n2013\nmale\n7.99452\n\n\n2\nC002353\nS100067\n2013\nmale\n7.99452\n\n\n3\nC002354\nS100067\n2013\nmale\n7.99452\n\n\n4\nC002355\nS100122\n2013\nfemale\n7.99452\n\n\n5\nC002356\nS100146\n2013\nmale\n7.99452\n\n\n6\nC002357\nS100146\n2013\nmale\n7.99452\n\n\n7\nC002358\nS100146\n2013\nmale\n7.99452\n\n\n8\nC002359\nS100183\n2013\nfemale\n7.99452\n\n\n9\nC002360\nS100195\n2013\nfemale\n7.99452\n\n\n10\nC002361\nS100213\n2013\nmale\n7.99452\n\n\n11\nC002362\nS100237\n2013\nfemale\n7.99452\n\n\n12\nC002363\nS100237\n2013\nfemale\n7.99452\n\n\n13\nC002364\nS100250\n2013\nfemale\n7.99452\n\n\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n\n\n108284\nC117943\nS130539\n2018\nfemale\n9.10609\n\n\n108285\nC117944\nS130539\n2018\nmale\n9.10609\n\n\n108286\nC117945\nS130539\n2018\nmale\n9.10609\n\n\n108287\nC117946\nS130539\n2018\nmale\n9.10609\n\n\n108288\nC117956\nS400580\n2018\nmale\n9.10609\n\n\n108289\nC117957\nS400919\n2018\nmale\n9.10609\n\n\n108290\nC117958\nS400919\n2018\nmale\n9.10609\n\n\n108291\nC117959\nS400919\n2018\nmale\n9.10609\n\n\n108292\nC117962\nS401250\n2018\nfemale\n9.10609\n\n\n108293\nC117964\nS401470\n2018\nmale\n9.10609\n\n\n108294\nC117965\nS401470\n2018\nfemale\n9.10609\n\n\n108295\nC117966\nS800200\n2018\nmale\n9.10609\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlength(unique(Child.Child))  # should be 108295\n\n108295\n\n\n\nfilesize(\n  Arrow.write(\"./data/fggk21_Child.arrow\", Child; compress=:lz4)\n)\n\n1774946\n\n\n\nfilesize(\n  Arrow.write(\n    \"./data/fggk21_Score.arrow\",\n    select(df, :Child, :Test, :score);\n    compress=:lz4,\n  ),\n)\n\n2794058\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA careful examination of the file sizes versus that of ./data/fggk21.arrow will show that the separate tables combined take up more space than the original because of the compression.

In some ways this is the most complicated expression in creating the plot so we will break it down. select is applied to DataFrame(dat), which is the conversion of the Arrow.Table, dat, to a DataFrame. This is necessary because an Arrow.Table is immutable but a DataFrame can be modified.\nThe arguments after the DataFrame describe how to modify the contents. The first : indicates that all the existing columns should be included. The other expression can be pairs (created with the =&gt; operator) of the form :col =&gt; function or of the form :col =&gt; function =&gt; :newname.

    "text": "The speed of MixedModels.jl relative to its predecessors makes the parametric bootstrap much more computationally tractable. This is valuable because the parametric bootstrap can be used to produce more accurate confidence intervals than methods based on standard errors or profiling of the likelihood surface.\nThis page is adapted from the MixedModels.jl docs\n\n1 The parametric bootstrap\nBootstrapping is a family of procedures for generating sample values of a statistic, allowing for visualization of the distribution of the statistic or for inference from this sample of values. Bootstrapping also belongs to a larger family of procedures called resampling, which are based on creating new samples of data from an existing one, then computing statistics on the new samples, in order to examine the distribution of the relevant statistics.\nA parametric bootstrap is used with a parametric model, m, that has been fit to data. The procedure is to simulate n response vectors from m using the estimated parameter values and refit m to these responses in turn, accumulating the statistics of interest at each iteration.\nThe parameters of a LinearMixedModel object are the fixed-effects parameters, β, the standard deviation, σ, of the per-observation noise, and the covariance parameter, θ, that defines the variance-covariance matrices of the random effects. A technical description of the covariance parameter can be found in the MixedModels.jl docs. Lisa Schwetlick and Daniel Backhaus have provided a more beginner-friendly description of the covariance parameter in the documentation for MixedModelsSim.jl. For today’s purposes – looking at the uncertainty in the estimates from a fitted model – we can simply use values from the fitted model, but we will revisit the parametric bootstrap as a convenient way to simulate new data, potentially with different parameter values, for power analysis.\nAttach the packages to be used\n\n\nCode\nusing AlgebraOfGraphics\nusing CairoMakie\nusing DataFrames\nusing MixedModels\nusing MixedModelsMakie\nusing Random\nusing SMLP2023: dataset\n\nusing AlgebraOfGraphics: AlgebraOfGraphics as AoG\nCairoMakie.activate!(; type=\"svg\") # use SVG (other options include PNG)\n\nimport ProgressMeter\nProgressMeter.ijulia_behavior(:clear);\n\n\nNote that the precise stream of random numbers generated for a given seed can change between Julia versions.

Furthermore, Grouping contrasts are assigned to the subj and item factors. This is not a contrast per-se but an indication that these factors will be used as grouping factors for random effects and, therefore, there is no need to create a contrast matrix. For large numbers of levels in a grouping factor, an attempt to create a contrast matrix may cause memory overflow.\nIt is not important in these cases but a good practice in any case.\nWe can look at an initial fit of moderate complexity:\n\nform = @formula(rt_trunc ~ 1 + spkr * prec * load +\n                          (1 + spkr + prec + load | subj) +\n                          (1 + spkr + prec + load | item))\nm0 = fit(MixedModel, form, kb07; contrasts)\n\nMinimizing 799   Time: 0:00:01 ( 1.68 ms/it)\n  objective:  28637.123623229592\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEst.\nSE\nz\np\nσ_subj\nσ_item\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n2181.6729\n77.3136\n28.22\n&lt;1e-99\n301.8062\n362.2579\n\n\nspkr: old\n67.7491\n18.2664\n3.71\n0.0002\n42.3795\n40.6807\n\n\nprec: maintain\n-333.9205\n47.1558\n-7.08\n&lt;1e-11\n61.9630\n246.9158\n\n\nload: yes\n78.7702\n19.5298\n4.03\n&lt;1e-04\n64.9751\n42.3890\n\n\nspkr: old & prec: maintain\n-21.9655\n15.8074\n-1.39\n0.1647\n\n\n\n\nspkr: old & load: yes\n18.3837\n15.8074\n1.16\n0.2448\n\n\n\n\nprec: maintain & load: yes\n4.5333\n15.8074\n0.29\n0.7743\n\n\n\n\nspkr: old & prec: maintain & load: yes\n23.6073\n15.8074\n1.49\n0.1353\n\n\n\n\nResidual\n668.5542\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default display in Quarto uses the pretty MIME show method for the model and omits the estimated correlations of the random effects.\nThe VarCorr extractor displays these.\n\nVarCorr(m0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nVariance\nStd.Dev\nCorr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsubj\n(Intercept)\n91087.0055\n301.8062\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspkr: old\n1796.0221\n42.3795\n+0.79\n\n\n\n\n\nprec: maintain\n3839.4126\n61.9630\n-0.59\n+0.02\n\n\n\n\nload: yes\n4221.7638\n64.9751\n+0.36\n+0.85\n+0.54\n\n\nitem\n(Intercept)\n131230.7914\n362.2579\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspkr: old\n1654.9232\n40.6807\n+0.44\n\n\n\n\n\nprec: maintain\n60967.4037\n246.9158\n-0.69\n+0.35\n\n\n\n\nload: yes\n1796.8284\n42.3890\n+0.32\n+0.16\n-0.14\n\n\nResidual\n\n446964.7062\n668.5542\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone of the two-factor or three-factor interaction terms in the fixed-effects are significant.

However, it is not as straightforward to detect singularity in vector-valued random-effects terms.\nFor example, if we bootstrap a model fit to the sleepstudy data\n\nsleepstudy = dataset(:sleepstudy)\nmsleep = fit(MixedModel, @formula(reaction ~ 1 + days + (1 + days | subj)),\n             sleepstudy)\n\n\n\n\n\nEst.\nSE\nz\np\nσ_subj\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n251.4051\n6.6323\n37.91\n&lt;1e-99\n23.7805\n\n\ndays\n10.4673\n1.5022\n6.97\n&lt;1e-11\n5.7168\n\n\nResidual\n25.5918\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsampsleep = parametricbootstrap(MersenneTwister(666), 10_000, msleep)\ntblsleep = sampsleep.tbl\n\nTable with 10 columns and 10000 rows:\n      obj      β1       β2       σ        σ1       σ2       ρ1          ⋯\n    ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n 1  │ 1721.95  252.488  11.0328  22.4544  29.6185  6.33343  0.233383    ⋯\n 2  │ 1760.85  260.763  8.55352  27.3835  20.8063  4.32895  0.914676    ⋯\n 3  │ 1750.88  246.709  12.4613  25.9951  15.8702  6.33404  0.200358    ⋯\n 4  │ 1777.33  247.683  12.9824  27.7966  27.5413  4.9878   0.121411    ⋯\n 5  │ 1738.05  245.649  10.5792  25.3596  21.5208  4.26131  0.0526768   ⋯\n 6  │ 1751.25  255.669  10.1984  26.1432  22.5389  4.58209  0.225968    ⋯\n 7  │ 1727.51  248.986  7.62095  24.6451  19.0858  4.34881  0.212916    ⋯\n 8  │ 1754.18  246.075  11.0469  26.9407  19.8341  4.55961  -0.202146   ⋯\n 9  │ 1757.47  245.407  13.7475  25.8265  20.0014  7.7647   -0.266385   ⋯\n 10 │ 1752.8   253.911  11.4977  25.7077  20.6409  6.27298  0.171494    ⋯\n 11 │ 1707.8   248.887  10.1608  23.9684  10.5923  4.32048  1.0         ⋯\n 12 │ 1773.69  252.542  10.7379  26.8795  27.7959  6.2055   0.156476    ⋯\n 13 │ 1761.27  254.712  11.0373  25.7998  23.2005  7.30831  0.368175    ⋯\n 14 │ 1737.0   260.299  10.5659  24.6504  29.0113  4.26877  -0.0785722  ⋯\n 15 │ 1760.12  258.949  10.1464  27.2089  8.02971  7.01898  0.727216    ⋯\n 16 │ 1723.7   249.204  11.7868  24.9861  18.6887  3.08433  0.633218    ⋯\n 17 │ 1734.14  262.586  8.96611  24.0011  26.7969  5.37598  0.29709     ⋯\n 18 │ 1788.8   260.376  11.658   28.6099  26.1245  5.85586  0.0323584   ⋯\n 19 │ 1752.44  239.962  11.0195  26.2388  23.2242  4.45586  0.482518    ⋯\n 20 │ 1752.92  258.171  11.6339  25.7146  27.3026  4.87036  0.225691    ⋯\n 21 │ 1740.81  254.09   7.91985  25.2195  16.2247  6.08679  0.462549    ⋯\n 22 │ 1756.6   245.791  10.3434  26.2627  23.289   5.50225  -0.143375   ⋯\n 23 │ 1759.01  256.131  9.10794  27.136   27.5008  3.51222  1.0         ⋯\n ⋮  │    ⋮        ⋮        ⋮        ⋮        ⋮        ⋮         ⋮       ⋱\n\n\nthe singularity can be exhibited as a standard deviation of zero or as a correlation of ±1.\n\nconfint(sampsleep)\n\nDictTable with 2 columns and 6 rows:\n par   lower      upper\n ────┬───────────────────\n β1  │ 237.905    264.231\n β2  │ 7.44545    13.3516\n ρ1  │ -0.409926  1.0\n σ   │ 22.6345    28.5125\n σ1  │ 10.6756    33.3567\n σ2  │ 3.07053    7.82204\n\n\nA histogram of the estimated correlations from the bootstrap sample has a spike at +1.\n\nplt = data(tblsleep) * mapping(:ρ1) * AoG.histogram(;bins=100)\ndraw(plt; axis=(;title=\"Parametric bootstrap samples of correlation of random effects\"))\n\n\n\n\nor, as a count,\n\ncount(tblsleep.ρ1  .≈ 1)\n\n293\n\n\nClose examination of the histogram shows a few values of -1.\n\ncount(tblsleep.ρ1 .≈ -1)\n\n2\n\n\nFurthermore there are even a few cases where the estimate of the standard deviation of the random effect for the intercept is zero.\n\ncount(tblsleep.σ1 .≈ 0)\n\n7\n\n\nThere is a general condition to check for singularity of an estimated covariance matrix or matrices in a bootstrap sample. The parameter optimized in the estimation is θ, the relative covariance parameter. Some of the elements of this parameter vector must be non-negative and, when one of these components is approximately zero, one of the covariance matrices will be singular.\nThe issingular method for a MixedModel object that tests if a parameter vector θ corresponds to a boundary or singular fit.\nThis operation is encapsulated in a method for the issingular function that works on MixedModelBootstrap objects.\n\ncount(issingular(sampsleep))\n\n302\n\n\n\n\n5 References\n\n\nKronmüller, E., & Barr, D.

    "section": "2.1 SeqDiffCoding: contr1",
    "text": "2.1 SeqDiffCoding: contr1\nSeqDiffCoding was used in the publication. This specification tests pairwise differences between the five neighboring levels of Test, that is:\n\nSDC1: 2-1\nSDC2: 3-2\nSDC3: 4-3\nSDC4: 5-4\n\nThe levels were sorted such that these contrasts map onto four a priori hypotheses; in other words, they are theoretically motivated pairwise comparisons. The motivation also encompasses theoretically motivated interactions with Sex. The order of levels can also be explicitly specified during contrast construction. This is very useful if levels are in a different order in the dataframe. We recommend the explicit specification to increase transparency of the code.\nThe statistical disadvantage of SeqDiffCoding is that the contrasts are not orthogonal, that is the contrasts are correlated. This is obvious from the fact that levels 2, 3, and 4 are all used in two contrasts. One consequence of this is that correlation parameters estimated between neighboring contrasts (e.g., 2-1 and 3-2) are difficult to interpret. Usually, they will be negative because assuming some practical limitation on the overall range (e.g., between levels 1 and 3), a small “2-1” effect “correlates” negatively with a larger “3-2” effect for mathematical reasons.\nObviously, the tradeoff between theoretical motivation and statistical purity is something that must be considered carefully when planning the analysis.\n\ncontr1 = merge(\n  Dict(nm =&gt; Grouping() for nm in (:School, :Child, :Cohort)),\n  Dict(\n    :Sex =&gt; EffectsCoding(; levels=[\"Girls\", \"Boys\"]),\n    :Test =&gt; SeqDiffCoding(;\n      levels=[\"Run\", \"Star_r\", \"S20_r\", \"SLJ\", \"BPT\"]\n    ),\n  ),\n)\n\nDict{Symbol, StatsModels.AbstractContrasts} with 5 entries:\n  :Child  =&gt; Grouping()\n  :School =&gt; Grouping()\n  :Test   =&gt; SeqDiffCoding([\"Run\", \"Star_r\", \"S20_r\", \"SLJ\", \"BPT\"])\n  :Cohort =&gt; Grouping()\n  :Sex    =&gt; EffectsCoding(nothing, [\"Girls\", \"Boys\"])\n\n\n\nf_ovi_1 = @formula zScore ~ 1 + Test + (1 | Child);\n\n\nm_ovi_SeqDiff_1 = fit(MixedModel, f_ovi_1, dat; contrasts=contr1)\n\n\n\n\n\nEst.\nSE\nz\np\nσ_Child\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-0.0004\n0.0143\n-0.03\n0.9783\n0.7826\n\n\nTest: Star_r\n-0.0014\n0.0442\n-0.03\n0.9756\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r\n0.0093\n0.0440\n0.21\n0.8332\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ\n-0.0005\n0.0441\n-0.01\n0.9911\n\n\n\nTest: BPT\n-0.0055\n0.0442\n-0.12\n0.9006\n\n\n\nResidual\n0.6228\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, any differences between tests identified by the contrasts would be spurious because each test was standardized (i.e., M=0, \\(SD\\)=1). The differences could also be due to an imbalance in the number of boys and girls or in the number of missing observations for each test.\nThe primary interest in this study related to interactions of the test contrasts with and age and Sex. We start with age (linear) and its interaction with the four test contrasts.\n\nm_ovi_SeqDiff_2 = let\n  form = @formula zScore ~ 1 + Test * a1 + (1 | Child)\n  fit(MixedModel, form, dat; contrasts=contr1)\nend\n\n\n\n\n\nEst.\nSE\nz\np\nσ_Child\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-0.0159\n0.0145\n-1.09\n0.2755\n0.7819\n\n\nTest: Star_r\n-0.0116\n0.0450\n-0.26\n0.7974\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r\n0.0082\n0.0447\n0.18\n0.8546\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ\n0.0047\n0.0448\n0.11\n0.9160\n\n\n\nTest: BPT\n-0.0234\n0.0450\n-0.52\n0.6037\n\n\n\na1\n0.2520\n0.0495\n5.09\n&lt;1e-06\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r & a1\n0.1796\n0.1541\n1.17\n0.2438\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r & a1\n0.0309\n0.1543\n0.20\n0.8414\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ & a1\n-0.1054\n0.1524\n-0.69\n0.4892\n\n\n\nTest: BPT & a1\n0.2569\n0.1501\n1.71\n0.0871\n\n\n\nResidual\n0.6186\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference between older and younger childrend is larger for Star_r than for Run (0.2473).

The sex difference is smaller when coordination and cognition play a role – as in the Star_r test. (Caveat: SEs are estimated with an underspecified RES.)\nThe final step in this first series is to add the interactions between the three covariates. A significant interaction between any of the four Test contrasts and age (linear) x Sex was hypothesized to reflect a prepubertal signal (i.e., hormones start to rise in girls’ ninth year of life). However, this hypothesis is linked to a specific shape of the interaction: Girls would need to gain more than boys in tests of muscular power.\n\nf_ovi = @formula zScore ~ 1 + Test * a1 * Sex + (1 | Child)\nm_ovi_SeqDiff = fit(MixedModel, f_ovi, dat; contrasts=contr1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEst.\nSE\nz\np\nσ_Child\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-0.0146\n0.0141\n-1.03\n0.3011\n0.7441\n\n\nTest: Star_r\n-0.0108\n0.0438\n-0.25\n0.8054\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r\n0.0090\n0.0435\n0.21\n0.8362\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ\n0.0077\n0.0435\n0.18\n0.8599\n\n\n\nTest: BPT\n-0.0252\n0.0438\n-0.58\n0.5644\n\n\n\na1\n0.2362\n0.0480\n4.92\n&lt;1e-06\n\n\n\nSex: Boys\n0.2298\n0.0141\n16.28\n&lt;1e-58\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r & a1\n0.1528\n0.1498\n1.02\n0.3076\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r & a1\n0.0279\n0.1500\n0.19\n0.8523\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ & a1\n-0.1310\n0.1483\n-0.88\n0.3769\n\n\n\nTest: BPT & a1\n0.2500\n0.1461\n1.71\n0.0869\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r & Sex: Boys\n-0.0961\n0.0438\n-2.20\n0.0280\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r & Sex: Boys\n0.0705\n0.0435\n1.62\n0.1048\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ & Sex: Boys\n0.0353\n0.0435\n0.81\n0.4178\n\n\n\nTest: BPT & Sex: Boys\n0.1218\n0.0438\n2.78\n0.0054\n\n\n\na1 & Sex: Boys\n-0.0557\n0.0480\n-1.16\n0.2460\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.1638\n0.1498\n1.09\n0.2742\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r & a1 & Sex: Boys\n-0.2711\n0.1500\n-1.81\n0.0707\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.0081\n0.1483\n0.05\n0.9563\n\n\n\nTest: BPT & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.2199\n0.1461\n1.51\n0.1322\n\n\n\nResidual\n0.6180\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results are very clear: Despite an abundance of statistical power there is no evidence for the differences between boys and girls in how much they gain in the ninth year of life in these five tests. The authors argue that, in this case, absence of evidence looks very much like evidence of absence of a hypothesized interaction.\nIn the next two sections we use different contrasts. Does this have a bearing on this result? We still ignore for now that we are looking at anti-conservative test statistics."

    "text": "2.2 HelmertCoding: contr2\nThe second set of contrasts uses HelmertCoding. Helmert coding codes each level as the difference from the average of the lower levels. With the default order of Test levels we get the following test statistics which we describe in reverse order of appearance in model output\n\nHeC4: 5 - mean(1,2,3,4)\nHeC3: 4 - mean(1,2,3)\nHeC2: 3 - mean(1,2)\nHeC1: 2 - 1\n\nIn the model output, HeC1 will be reported first and HeC4 last.\nThere is some justification for the HeC4 specification in a post-hoc manner because the fifth test (BPT) turned out to be different from the other four tests in that high performance is most likely not only related to physical fitness, but also to overweight/obesity, that is for a subset of children high scores on this test might be indicative of physical unfitness. A priori the SDC4 contrast 5-4 between BPT (5) and SLJ (4) was motivated because conceptually both are tests of the physical fitness component Muscular Power, BPT for upper limbs and SLJ for lower limbs, respectively.\nOne could argue that there is justification for HeC3 because Run (1), Star_r (2), and S20 (3) involve running but SLJ (4) does not. Sports scientists, however, recoil. For them it does not make much sense to average the different running tests, because they draw on completely different physiological resources; it is a variant of the old apples-and-oranges problem.\nThe justification for HeC3 is thatRun (1) and Star_r (2) draw more strongly on cardiosrespiratory Endurance than S20 (3) due to the longer duration of the runs compared to sprinting for 20 m which is a pure measure of the physical-fitness component Speed. Again, sports scientists are not very happy with this proposal.\nFinally, HeC1 contrasts the fitness components Endurance, indicated best by Run (1), and Coordination, indicated by Star_r (2). Endurance (i.e., running for 6 minutes) is considered to be the best indicator of health-related status among the five tests because it is a rather pure measure of cardiorespiratory fitness. The Star_r test requires execution of a pre-instructed sequence of forward, sideways, and backward runs. This coordination of body movements implies a demand on working memory (i.e., remembering the order of these subruns) and executive control processes, but performats also depends on endurance. HeC1 yields a measure of Coordination “corrected” for the contribution of Endurance.\nThe statistical advantage of HelmertCoding is that the resulting contrasts are orthogonal (uncorrelated). This allows for optimal partitioning of variance and statistical power. It is also more efficient to estimate “orthogonal” than “non-orthogonal” random-effect structures.\n\ncontr2 = Dict(\n  :School =&gt; Grouping(),\n  :Child =&gt; Grouping(),\n  :Cohort =&gt; Grouping(),\n  :Sex =&gt; EffectsCoding(; levels=[\"Girls\", \"Boys\"]),\n  :Test =&gt; HelmertCoding(;\n    levels=[\"Run\", \"Star_r\", \"S20_r\", \"SLJ\", \"BPT\"],\n  ),\n);\n\n\nm_ovi_Helmert = fit(MixedModel, f_ovi, dat; contrasts=contr2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEst.\nSE\nz\np\nσ_Child\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-0.0146\n0.0141\n-1.03\n0.3011\n0.7441\n\n\nTest: Star_r\n-0.0054\n0.0219\n-0.25\n0.8054\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r\n0.0012\n0.0125\n0.10\n0.9238\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ\n0.0025\n0.0089\n0.28\n0.7774\n\n\n\nTest: BPT\n-0.0035\n0.0069\n-0.51\n0.6086\n\n\n\na1\n0.2362\n0.0480\n4.92\n&lt;1e-06\n\n\n\nSex: Boys\n0.2298\n0.0141\n16.28\n&lt;1e-58\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r & a1\n0.0764\n0.0749\n1.02\n0.3076\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r & a1\n0.0348\n0.0434\n0.80\n0.4227\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ & a1\n-0.0154\n0.0299\n-0.51\n0.6079\n\n\n\nTest: BPT & a1\n0.0408\n0.0232\n1.76\n0.0786\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r & Sex: Boys\n-0.0481\n0.0219\n-2.20\n0.0280\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r & Sex: Boys\n0.0075\n0.0125\n0.60\n0.5508\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ & Sex: Boys\n0.0126\n0.0089\n1.41\n0.1591\n\n\n\nTest: BPT & Sex: Boys\n0.0319\n0.0069\n4.62\n&lt;1e-05\n\n\n\na1 & Sex: Boys\n-0.0557\n0.0480\n-1.16\n0.2460\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.0819\n0.0749\n1.09\n0.2742\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r & a1 & Sex: Boys\n-0.0631\n0.0434\n-1.45\n0.1461\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ & a1 & Sex: Boys\n-0.0295\n0.0299\n-0.99\n0.3244\n\n\n\nTest: BPT & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.0263\n0.0232\n1.13\n0.2571\n\n\n\nResidual\n0.6180\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe forego a detailed discussion of the effects, but note that again none of the interactions between age x Sex with the four test contrasts was significant.\nThe default labeling of Helmert contrasts may lead to confusions with other contrasts.

Unfortunately, it is not easy, actually rather quite difficult, to grasp the meaning of correlations of contrast-based effects; they represent two-way interactions.\n\nbegin\n  f_Child = @formula zScore ~\n    1 + Test * a1 * Sex + (1 + Test | Child)\n  m_Child_SDC = fit(MixedModel, f_Child, dat; contrasts=contr1)\n  m_Child_HeC = fit(MixedModel, f_Child, dat; contrasts=contr2)\n  m_Child_HyC = fit(MixedModel, f_Child, dat; contrasts=contr3)\n  m_Child_PCA = fit(MixedModel, f_Child, dat; contrasts=contr4)\nend\n\nMinimizing 1681      Time: 0:00:09 ( 5.75 ms/it)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEst.\nSE\nz\np\nσ_Child\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-0.0140\n0.0141\n-0.99\n0.3217\n0.7540\n\n\nTest: c5.1\n-0.0231\n0.0432\n-0.53\n0.5931\n1.3977\n\n\nTest: c234.15\n0.0251\n0.1680\n0.15\n0.8811\n1.3502\n\n\nTest: c2.34\n-0.0316\n0.0764\n-0.41\n0.6798\n1.1365\n\n\nTest: c3.4\n-0.0048\n0.0440\n-0.11\n0.9124\n1.0727\n\n\na1\n0.2374\n0.0480\n4.95\n&lt;1e-06\n\n\n\nSex: Boys\n0.2300\n0.0141\n16.32\n&lt;1e-59\n\n\n\nTest: c5.1 & a1\n0.2815\n0.1458\n1.93\n0.0536\n\n\n\nTest: c234.15 & a1\n-0.1049\n0.5709\n-0.18\n0.8543\n\n\n\nTest: c2.34 & a1\n0.0733\n0.2610\n0.28\n0.7788\n\n\n\nTest: c3.4 & a1\n0.1284\n0.1499\n0.86\n0.3915\n\n\n\nTest: c5.1 & Sex: Boys\n0.1237\n0.0432\n2.87\n0.0042\n\n\n\nTest: c234.15 & Sex: Boys\n-0.6244\n0.1680\n-3.72\n0.0002\n\n\n\nTest: c2.34 & Sex: Boys\n-0.1842\n0.0764\n-2.41\n0.0159\n\n\n\nTest: c3.4 & Sex: Boys\n-0.0331\n0.0440\n-0.75\n0.4525\n\n\n\na1 & Sex: Boys\n-0.0546\n0.0480\n-1.14\n0.2554\n\n\n\nTest: c5.1 & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.0979\n0.1458\n0.67\n0.5018\n\n\n\nTest: c234.15 & a1 & Sex: Boys\n-0.4897\n0.5709\n-0.86\n0.3910\n\n\n\nTest: c2.34 & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.5315\n0.2610\n2.04\n0.0417\n\n\n\nTest: c3.4 & a1 & Sex: Boys\n-0.0054\n0.1499\n-0.04\n0.9714\n\n\n\nResidual\n0.0000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarCorr(m_Child_SDC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nVariance\nStd.Dev\nCorr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChild\n(Intercept)\n0.56211796\n0.74974526\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r\n0.52251672\n0.72285318\n+0.29\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r\n0.69271093\n0.83229257\n-0.12\n+0.24\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ\n0.81392090\n0.90217565\n-0.07\n-0.55\n-0.05\n\n\n\n\nTest: BPT\n0.43000263\n0.65574586\n+0.22\n+0.34\n-0.80\n-0.36\n\n\nResidual\n\n0.00000000\n0.00002102\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarCorr(m_Child_HeC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nVariance\nStd.Dev\nCorr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChild\n(Intercept)\n0.43353075\n0.65843052\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: Star_r\n0.18629729\n0.43162169\n+0.28\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: S20_r\n0.15806152\n0.39756952\n+0.09\n+0.56\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ\n0.05583349\n0.23629112\n+0.02\n-0.44\n+0.48\n\n\n\n\nTest: BPT\n0.02466654\n0.15705584\n+0.03\n+0.30\n+0.44\n+0.14\n\n\nResidual\n\n0.00000000\n0.00004079\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarCorr(m_Child_HyC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nVariance\nStd.Dev\nCorr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChild\n(Intercept)\n0.55282557\n0.74352241\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: BPT-other\n0.67427276\n0.82114113\n+1.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: Star-End\n0.99071927\n0.99534882\n+0.30\n+0.31\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: S20-Star\n1.20348486\n1.09703458\n-0.15\n-0.13\n-0.03\n\n\n\n\nTest: SLJ-S20\n0.59215750\n0.76951771\n+0.17\n+0.16\n-0.13\n-0.51\n\n\nResidual\n\n0.00000000\n0.00002684\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarCorr(m_Child_PCA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nVariance\nStd.Dev\nCorr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChild\n(Intercept)\n0.56856388\n0.75403175\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: c5.1\n1.95351062\n1.39768044\n-0.03\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: c234.15\n1.82313476\n1.35023508\n+0.88\n+0.03\n\n\n\n\n\nTest: c2.34\n1.29169133\n1.13652599\n+0.18\n-0.25\n+0.54\n\n\n\n\nTest: c3.4\n1.15071042\n1.07271171\n-0.01\n-0.06\n+0.24\n+0.07\n\n\nResidual\n\n0.00000000\n0.00000607\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CPs for the various contrasts are in line with expectations. For the SDC we observe substantial negative CPs between neighboring contrasts. For the orthogonal HeC, all CPs are small; they are uncorrelated. HyC contains some of the SDC contrasts and we observe again the negative CPs. The (roughly) PCA-based contrasts are small with one exception; there is a sizeable CP of +.41 between GM and the core of adjusted physical fitness (c234.15).\nDo these differences in CPs imply that we can move to zcpLMMs when we have orthogonal contrasts? We pursue this question with by refitting the four LMMs with zerocorr() and compare the goodness of fit.\n\nbegin\n  f_Child0 = @formula zScore ~\n    1 + Test * a1 * Sex + zerocorr(1 + Test | Child)\n  m_Child_SDC0 = fit(MixedModel, f_Child0, dat; contrasts=contr1)\n  m_Child_HeC0 = fit(MixedModel, f_Child0, dat; contrasts=contr2)\n  m_Child_HyC0 = fit(MixedModel, f_Child0, dat; contrasts=contr3)\n  m_Child_PCA0 = fit(MixedModel, f_Child0, dat; contrasts=contr4)\nend\n\nMinimizing 473   Time: 0:00:01 ( 4.00 ms/it)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEst.\nSE\nz\np\nσ_Child\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-0.0146\n0.0142\n-1.03\n0.3024\n0.8465\n\n\nTest: c5.1\n-0.0208\n0.0430\n-0.48\n0.6285\n0.8888\n\n\nTest: c234.15\n0.0492\n0.1661\n0.30\n0.7672\n0.9984\n\n\nTest: c2.34\n-0.0384\n0.0744\n-0.52\n0.6063\n1.2892\n\n\nTest: c3.4\n-0.0062\n0.0442\n-0.14\n0.8892\n0.9230\n\n\na1\n0.2381\n0.0482\n4.93\n&lt;1e-06\n\n\n\nSex: Boys\n0.2297\n0.0142\n16.19\n&lt;1e-58\n\n\n\nTest: c5.1 & a1\n0.2937\n0.1454\n2.02\n0.0434\n\n\n\nTest: c234.15 & a1\n-0.1040\n0.5646\n-0.18\n0.8538\n\n\n\nTest: c2.34 & a1\n0.0702\n0.2540\n0.28\n0.7823\n\n\n\nTest: c3.4 & a1\n0.1182\n0.1509\n0.78\n0.4334\n\n\n\nTest: c5.1 & Sex: Boys\n0.1182\n0.0430\n2.75\n0.0060\n\n\n\nTest: c234.15 & Sex: Boys\n-0.6206\n0.1661\n-3.74\n0.0002\n\n\n\nTest: c2.34 & Sex: Boys\n-0.1750\n0.0744\n-2.35\n0.0187\n\n\n\nTest: c3.4 & Sex: Boys\n-0.0325\n0.0442\n-0.73\n0.4632\n\n\n\na1 & Sex: Boys\n-0.0548\n0.0482\n-1.13\n0.2564\n\n\n\nTest: c5.1 & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.1211\n0.1454\n0.83\n0.4049\n\n\n\nTest: c234.15 & a1 & Sex: Boys\n-0.3976\n0.5646\n-0.70\n0.4812\n\n\n\nTest: c2.34 & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.5051\n0.2540\n1.99\n0.0467\n\n\n\nTest: c3.4 & a1 & Sex: Boys\n0.0003\n0.1509\n0.00\n0.9984\n\n\n\nResidual\n0.0000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixedModels.likelihoodratiotest(m_Child_SDC0, m_Child_SDC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel-dof\ndeviance\nχ²\nχ²-dof\nP(&gt;χ²)\n\n\n\n\nzScore ~ 1 + Test + a1 + Sex + Test & a1 + Test & Sex + a1 & Sex + Test & a1 & Sex + zerocorr(1 + Test | Child)\n26\n13295\n\n\n\n\n\nzScore ~ 1 + Test + a1 + Sex + Test & a1 + Test & Sex + a1 & Sex + Test & a1 & Sex + (1 + Test | Child)\n36\n13325\n-30\n10\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixedModels.likelihoodratiotest(m_Child_HeC0, m_Child_HeC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel-dof\ndeviance\nχ²\nχ²-dof\nP(&gt;χ²)\n\n\n\n\nzScore ~ 1 + Test + a1 + Sex + Test & a1 + Test & Sex + a1 & Sex + Test & a1 & Sex + zerocorr(1 + Test | Child)\n26\n13248\n\n\n\n\n\nzScore ~ 1 + Test + a1 + Sex + Test & a1 + Test & Sex + a1 & Sex + Test & a1 & Sex + (1 + Test | Child)\n36\n13354\n-107\n10\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixedModels.likelihoodratiotest(m_Child_HyC0, m_Child_HyC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel-dof\ndeviance\nχ²\nχ²-dof\nP(&gt;χ²)\n\n\n\n\nzScore ~ 1 + Test + a1 + Sex + Test & a1 + Test & Sex + a1 & Sex + Test & a1 & Sex + zerocorr(1 + Test | Child)\n26\n13333\n\n\n\n\n\nzScore ~ 1 + Test + a1 + Sex + Test & a1 + Test & Sex + a1 & Sex + Test & a1 & Sex + (1 + Test | Child)\n36\n13336\n-4\n10\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixedModels.likelihoodratiotest(m_Child_PCA0, m_Child_PCA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel-dof\ndeviance\nχ²\nχ²-dof\nP(&gt;χ²)\n\n\n\n\nzScore ~ 1 + Test + a1 + Sex + Test & a1 + Test & Sex + a1 & Sex + Test & a1 & Sex + zerocorr(1 + Test | Child)\n26\n13260\n\n\n\n\n\nzScore ~ 1 + Test + a1 + Sex + Test & a1 + Test & Sex + a1 & Sex + Test & a1 & Sex + (1 + Test | Child)\n36\n13273\n-13\n10\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\nObviously, we can not drop CPs from any of the LMMs. The full LMMs all have the same objective, but we can compare the goodness-of-fit statistics of zcpLMMs more directly.\n\nbegin\n  zcpLMM = [\"SDC0\", \"HeC0\", \"HyC0\", \"PCA0\"]\n  mods = [m_Child_SDC0, m_Child_HeC0, m_Child_HyC0, m_Child_PCA0]\n  gof_summary = sort!(\n    DataFrame(;\n      zcpLMM=zcpLMM,\n      dof=dof.(mods),\n      deviance=deviance.(mods),\n      AIC=aic.(mods),\n      BIC=bic.(mods),\n    ),\n    :deviance,\n  )\nend\n\n4×5 DataFrame\n\n\n\nRow\nzcpLMM\ndof\ndeviance\nAIC\nBIC\n\n\n\nString\nInt64\nFloat64\nFloat64\nFloat64\n\n\n\n\n1\nHeC0\n26\n13247.7\n13299.7\n13469.2\n\n\n2\nPCA0\n26\n13259.9\n13311.9\n13481.3\n\n\n3\nSDC0\n26\n13294.7\n13346.7\n13516.1\n\n\n4\nHyC0\n26\n13332.7\n13384.7\n13554.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best fit was obtained for the PCA-based zcpLMM.

I thought it might be related to imbalance in design in the present data, but this does not appear to be the case. The same comparison of SequentialDifferenceCoding and Helmert Coding also showed a worse fit for the zcp-HeC LMM than the zcp-SDC LMM."

    "text": "3.2 Extract a stratified subsample\nFor the prupose of the tutorial, we extract a random sample of 1000 boys and 1000 girls. Child, School, and Cohort are grouping variables. Traditionally, they are called random factors because the units (levels) of the factor are assumed to be a random sample from the population of their units (levels).\nCohort has only nine “groups” and could have been included as a set of polynomical fixed-effect contrasts rather than a random factor. This choice warrants a short excursion: The secular trends are very different for different tests and require the inclusion of interaction terms with Test contrasts (see Figure 4 in (Fühner et al., 2021). The authors opted to absorb these effects in cohort-related variance components for the Test contrasts and plan to address the details of secular changes in a separate analysis.\nFor complex designs, when they are in the theoretical focus of an article, factors and covariates should be specified as part of the fixed effects. If they are not in the theoretical focus, but serve as statistical control variables, they could be put in the RES - if supported by the data.\nStratified sampling: We generate a Child table with information about children. MersenneTwister(42) specifies 42 as the seed for the random number generator to ensure reproducibility of the stratification. For a different pattern of results choose, for example, 84. We randomly sample 1000 boys and 1000 girls from this table; they are stored in samp. Then, we extract the corresponding subset of these children’s test scores from df and store them dat.\n\nChild = unique(select(df, :Cohort, :School, :Child, :Sex, :age))\nsample = let\n  rng = MersenneTwister(42)\n  combine(\n    groupby(Child, :Sex), x -&gt; x[rand(rng, 1:nrow(x), 1000), :]\n  )\nend\ninsamp(x) = x ∈ sample.Child\ndat = @subset(df, insamp(:Child))\n\n9663×8 DataFrame9638 rows omitted\n\n\n\nRow\nTest\nCohort\nSchool\nChild\nSex\nage\na1\nzScore\n\n\n\nCat…\nString\nString\nString\nCat…\nFloat64\nFloat64\nFloat64\n\n\n\n\n1\nSpeed\n2013\nS101540\nC002482\nGirls\n7.99452\n-0.505476\n0.0551481\n\n\n2\nPowerUP\n2013\nS101540\nC002482\nGirls\n7.99452\n-0.505476\n-0.342524\n\n\n3\nPowerLOW\n2013\nS101540\nC002482\nGirls\n7.99452\n-0.505476\n0.74162\n\n\n4\nCoordination\n2013\nS101540\nC002482\nGirls\n7.99452\n-0.505476\n-0.209186\n\n\n5\nEndurance\n2013\nS101540\nC002482\nGirls\n7.99452\n-0.505476\n-0.127938\n\n\n6\nSpeed\n2013\nS102090\nC002513\nGirls\n7.99452\n-0.505476\n-0.422921\n\n\n7\nPowerUP\n2013\nS102090\nC002513\nGirls\n7.99452\n-0.505476\n-0.762963\n\n\n8\nPowerLOW\n2013\nS102090\nC002513\nGirls\n7.99452\n-0.505476\n-0.188712\n\n\n9\nCoordination\n2013\nS102090\nC002513\nGirls\n7.99452\n-0.505476\n0.81382\n\n\n10\nEndurance\n2013\nS102090\nC002513\nGirls\n7.99452\n-0.505476\n0.452557\n\n\n11\nSpeed\n2013\nS103299\nC002621\nGirls\n7.99452\n-0.505476\n0.859704\n\n\n12\nPowerUP\n2013\nS103299\nC002621\nGirls\n7.99452\n-0.505476\n0.218061\n\n\n13\nPowerLOW\n2013\nS103299\nC002621\nGirls\n7.99452\n-0.505476\n0.74162\n\n\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n\n\n9652\nCoordination\n2018\nS111508\nC117805\nGirls\n9.10609\n0.606092\n-0.95589\n\n\n9653\nEndurance\n2018\nS111508\nC117805\nGirls\n9.10609\n0.606092\n-1.67367\n\n\n9654\nSpeed\n2018\nS111648\nC117827\nBoys\n9.10609\n0.606092\n0.859704\n\n\n9655\nPowerUP\n2018\nS111648\nC117827\nBoys\n9.10609\n0.606092\n0.6385\n\n\n9656\nPowerLOW\n2018\nS111648\nC117827\nBoys\n9.10609\n0.606092\n0.483194\n\n\n9657\nCoordination\n2018\nS111648\nC117827\nBoys\n9.10609\n0.606092\n0.708474\n\n\n9658\nEndurance\n2018\nS111648\nC117827\nBoys\n9.10609\n0.606092\n-0.337186\n\n\n9659\nSpeed\n2018\nS112197\nC117868\nBoys\n9.10609\n0.606092\n0.578748\n\n\n9660\nPowerUP\n2018\nS112197\nC117868\nBoys\n9.10609\n0.606092\n0.498354\n\n\n9661\nPowerLOW\n2018\nS112197\nC117868\nBoys\n9.10609\n0.606092\n-0.550508\n\n\n9662\nCoordination\n2018\nS112197\nC117868\nBoys\n9.10609\n0.606092\n0.538978\n\n\n9663\nEndurance\n2018\nS112197\nC117868\nBoys\n9.10609\n0.606092\n0.938553\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to missing scores for some tests we have about 2% less than 10,000 observtions."

(2021). In summary:\n\nMain effects of age and Sex: There are developmental gains in the ninth year of life; boys outperform girls. There is no main effect of Test because of z-scoring.\nInteractions of Test and age: Tests differ in how much children improve during the year (i.e., the magnitude of developmental gain), that is slopes depend on Test.\nInteractions of Test and Sex: The sex difference is test dependent, that is the difference between the slopes depends on Test.\nThe most distinctive result is the absence of evidence for an age x Sex x Test interaction, that is the slopes for boys and girls are statistically parallel for each of the five tests.\n\n\n\nCode\nlet\n  design1 = mapping(:age, :zScore; color=:Sex, col=:Test)\n  lines1 = design1 * linear()\n  means1 = design1 * visual(Scatter; markersize=5)\n  draw(data(df2) * means1 + data(df) * lines1;)\nend\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Age trends by sex for each Test for the full data set\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows performance differences for the full set of data between 8.0 and 9.2 years by sex in the five physical fitness tests presented as z-transformed data computed separately for each test.\n\nEndurance = cardiorespiratory endurance (i.e., 6-min-run test),\nCoordination = star-run test,\nSpeed = 20-m linear sprint test,\nPowerLOW = power of lower limbs (i.e., standing long jump test),\nPowerUP = power of upper limbs (i.e., ball push test),\nSD = standard deviation. Points are binned observed child means; lines are simple regression fits to the observations.\n\nWhat do the results look like for the stratified subsample? Here the parallelism is much less clear. In the final LMM we test whether the two regression lines in each of the five panels are statistically parallel for this subset of data. That is, we test the interaction of Sex and age as nested within the levels of Test. Most people want to know the signficance of these five Sex x age interactions.\nThe theoretical focus of the article, however, is on comparisons between tests displayed next to each other. We ask whether the degree of parallelism is statistically the same for Endurance and Coordination (H1), Coordination and Speed (H2), Speed and PowerLOW (H3), and PowerLow and PowerUP (H4). Hypotheses H1 to H4 require Sequential Difference contrasts c1 to c4 for Test; they are tested as fixed effects for`H1 x age x Sex, H2 x age x Sex, H3 x age x Sex, and H4 x age x Sex.\n\n\nCode\ndat2 = combine(\n  groupby(\n    select(dat, :, :age =&gt; ByRow(x -&gt; round(x; digits=1)) =&gt; :age),\n    [:Sex, :Test, :age],\n  ),\n  :zScore =&gt; mean =&gt; :zScore,\n  :zScore =&gt; length =&gt; :n,\n)\n\n\n120×5 DataFrame95 rows omitted\n\n\n\nRow\nSex\nTest\nage\nzScore\nn\n\n\n\nCat…\nCat…\nFloat64\nFloat64\nInt64\n\n\n\n\n1\nGirls\nSpeed\n8.0\n-0.323114\n28\n\n\n2\nGirls\nPowerUP\n8.0\n-0.590476\n26\n\n\n3\nGirls\nPowerLOW\n8.0\n0.0677992\n27\n\n\n4\nGirls\nCoordination\n8.0\n0.0273318\n25\n\n\n5\nGirls\nEndurance\n8.0\n-0.17337\n26\n\n\n6\nBoys\nSpeed\n8.0\n0.394634\n19\n\n\n7\nBoys\nPowerUP\n8.0\n0.328703\n19\n\n\n8\nBoys\nPowerLOW\n8.0\n0.105077\n19\n\n\n9\nBoys\nCoordination\n8.0\n-0.170018\n19\n\n\n10\nBoys\nEndurance\n8.0\n0.407084\n19\n\n\n11\nGirls\nSpeed\n8.1\n-0.205934\n54\n\n\n12\nGirls\nPowerUP\n8.1\n-0.653961\n54\n\n\n13\nGirls\nPowerLOW\n8.1\n-0.157127\n54\n\n\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n\n\n109\nGirls\nCoordination\n9.0\n-0.000188842\n68\n\n\n110\nGirls\nEndurance\n9.0\n-0.234448\n68\n\n\n111\nGirls\nSpeed\n9.1\n-0.285047\n25\n\n\n112\nGirls\nPowerUP\n9.1\n-0.112684\n25\n\n\n113\nGirls\nPowerLOW\n9.1\n-0.117645\n24\n\n\n114\nGirls\nCoordination\n9.1\n-0.127844\n25\n\n\n115\nGirls\nEndurance\n9.1\n-0.587496\n24\n\n\n116\nBoys\nSpeed\n9.1\n0.379808\n17\n\n\n117\nBoys\nPowerUP\n9.1\n0.523085\n17\n\n\n118\nBoys\nPowerLOW\n9.1\n0.294696\n17\n\n\n119\nBoys\nCoordination\n9.1\n0.209309\n16\n\n\n120\nBoys\nEndurance\n9.1\n0.266512\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlet\n  design2 = mapping(:age, :zScore; color=:Sex, col=:Test)\n  lines2 = design2 * linear()\n  means2 = design2 * visual(Scatter; markersize=5)\n  draw(data(dat2) * means2 + data(dat) * lines2;)\nend\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Age trends by sex for each Test for the stratified sample\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 Performance differences for subset of data between 8.0 and 9.2 years by sex in the five physical fitness tests presented as z-transformed data computed separately for each test.\n\nEndurance = cardiorespiratory endurance (i.e., 6-min-run test),\nCoordination = star-run test,\nSpeed = 20-m linear sprint test,\nPowerLOW = power of lower limbs (i.e., standing long jump test),\nPowerUP = power of upper limbs (i.e., ball push test),\nSD = standard deviation.

    "section": "3.4 SeqDiffCoding of Test",
    "text": "3.4 SeqDiffCoding of Test\nSeqDiffCoding was used in the publication. This specification tests pairwise differences between the five neighboring levels of Test, that is:\n\nH1: Star_r - Run (2-1)\nH2: S20_r - Star_r (3-2)\nH3: SLJ - S20_r (4-3)\nH4: BPT - SLJ (5-4)\n\nThe levels were sorted such that these contrasts map onto four a priori hypotheses; in other words, they are theoretically motivated pairwise comparisons. The motivation also encompasses theoretically motivated interactions with Sex. The order of levels can also be explicitly specified during contrast construction. This is very useful if levels are in a different order in the dataframe.\nNote that random factors Child, School, and Cohort are declared as Grouping variables. Technically, this specification is required for variables with a very large number of levels (e.g., 100K+ children). We recommend the explicit specification for all random factors as a general coding style.\nThe first command recodes names indicating the physical fitness components used in the above figures and tables back to the shorter actual test names. This reduces clutter in LMM outputs.\n\nrecode!(\n  dat.Test,\n  \"Endurance\" =&gt; \"Run\",\n  \"Coordination\" =&gt; \"Star_r\",\n  \"Speed\" =&gt; \"S20_r\",\n  \"PowerLOW\" =&gt; \"SLJ\",\n  \"PowerUP\" =&gt; \"BMT\",\n)\ncontrasts = merge(\n  Dict(nm =&gt; SeqDiffCoding() for nm in (:Test, :Sex)),\n  Dict(nm =&gt; Grouping() for nm in (:Child, :School, :Cohort)),\n);\n\nThe statistical disadvantage of SeqDiffCoding is that the contrasts are not orthogonal, that is the contrasts are correlated. This is obvious from the fact that levels 2, 3, and 4 are all used in two contrasts. One consequence of this is that correlation parameters estimated between neighboring contrasts (e.g., 2-1 and 3-2) are difficult to interpret. Usually, they will be negative because assuming some practical limitations on the overall range (e.g., between levels 1 and 3), a small “2-1” effect “correlates” negatively with a larger “3-2” effect for mathematical reasons.\nObviously, the tradeoff between theoretical motivation and statistical purity is something that must be considered carefully when planning the analysis.\nVarious options for contrast coding are the topic of the MixedModelsTutorial_contrasts_emotikon.jl and MixedModelsTutorial_contrasts_kwdyz.jl notebooks."

Usually, χ² should be larger than the associated degrees of freedom; for AIC and BIC the decrease should amount to more than 5, according to some literature. Severity of meeting these criteria increases from deviance to AIC to BIC. Therefore, it is not always the case that the criteria are unanimous in their verdict. Basically, the more confirmatory the analysis, the more one may go with deviance and AIC; for exploratory analyses the BIC is probably a better guide.

For main effects of age and Sex, z-values decrease strongly with the complexity of the model (i.e., standard errors are larger). For other coefficients, the changes are not very large and not consistent.\nIn general, dropping significant variance components and/or correlation parameters may lead to anti-conservative estimates of fixed effects (e.g., Schielzeth & Forstmeier, 2008). Basically, some of the variance allocated to age and Sex in LMM m_ovi could also be due to differences between schools. This ambiguity increased the uncertainty of the respective fixed effects in the other two LMMs."

What if we include VCs and CPs related to random factors Child and School?"

(2021) included random factors for School, Child, and Cohort. The RES for School was specified like in LMM m_cpx. The RES for Child included VCs and CPs for Test, but not for linear developmental gain in the ninth year of life a1 or Sex; they are between-Child effects.\nThe RES for Cohort included only VCs, no CPs for Test. The parsimony was due to the small number of nine levels for this grouping factor.\nHere we fit this LMM m1 for the reduced data. For a different subset of similar size on MacBook Pro [13 | 15 | 16] this took [303 | 250 | 244 ] s; for LMM m1a (i.e., dropping 1 school-relate VC for Sex), times are [212 | 165 | 160] s. The corresponding lme4 times for LMM m1 are [397 | 348 | 195].\nFinally, times for fitting the full set of data –not in this script–, for LMM m1are [60 | 62 | 85] minutes (!); for LMM m1a the times were [46 | 48 | 34] minutes. It was not possible to fit the full set of data with lme4; after about 13 to 18 minutes the program stopped with: Error in eval_f(x, ...) : Downdated VtV is not positive definite.\n\nm1 = let\n  f = @formula(\n    zScore ~\n      1 +\n      Test * a1 * Sex +\n      (1 + Test + a1 + Sex | School) +\n      (1 + Test | Child) +\n      zerocorr(1 + Test | Cohort)\n  )\n  fit(MixedModel, f, dat;

    "text": "4.8 Effects in RES\nFor every random factor, MixedModels.PCA() extracts as many PCs as there are VCs. Therefore, the cumulation of variance across PCs within a random factor will always add up to 100% – at the latest with the last VC, but, in the case of overparameterized LMMs, the ceiling will be reached earlier. The final PCs are usually quite small.\nPCs are extracted in the order of the amount of unique variance they account for. The first PC accounts for the largest and the final PC for the least amount of variance. The number the PCs with percent variance above a certain threshold indicates the number of weighted composites needed and reflects the dimensionality of the orthogonal space within which (almost) all the variance can be accounted for. The weights for forming composite scores are the listed loadings. For ease of interpretation it is often useful to change the sign of some composite scores.\nThe PCA for LMM m1 shows that each of the five PCs for Child accounts for a non-zero percent of unique variance.\nFor School fewer than seven PCs have unique variance. The exact number depends on sampling. The overparameterization of School might be resolved when the CPs for Sex are dropped from the LMM.\nCohort was estimated with CPs forced to zero. Therefore, the VCs were forced to be orthogonal; they already represent the PCA solution. However, depending on sampling, not all PCs may be identified for this random factor either.\nImportantly, again depending on sampling, a non-singular fit does not imply that unique variance is associated with all PCs (i.e., not for last PC for School).

    "text": "Kliegl et al. (2015) is a follow-up to Kliegl et al. (2011) (see also script kwdyz11.qmd) from an experiment looking at a variety of effects of visual cueing under four different cue-target relations (CTRs). In this experiment two rectangles are displayed (1) in horizontal orientation , (2) in vertical orientation, (3) in left diagonal orientation, or in (4) right diagonal orientation relative to a central fixation point. Subjects react to the onset of a small or a large visual target occurring at one of the four ends of the two rectangles. The target is cued validly on 70% of trials by a brief flash of the corner of the rectangle at which it appears; it is cued invalidly at the three other locations 10% of the trials each. This implies a latent imbalance in design that is not visible in the repeated-measures ANOVA, but we will show its effect in the random-effect structure and conditional modes.\nThere are a couple of differences between the first and this follow-up experiment, rendering it more a conceptual than a direct replication. First, the original experiment was carried out at Peking University and this follow-up at Potsdam University. Second, diagonal orientations of rectangles and large target sizes were not part of the design of Kliegl et al. (2011).\nWe specify three contrasts for the four-level factor CTR that are derived from spatial, object-based, and attractor-like features of attention. They map onto sequential differences between appropriately ordered factor levels. Replicating Kliegl et al. (2011), the attraction effect was not significant as a fixed effect, but yielded a highly reliable variance component (VC; i.e., reliable individual differences in positive and negative attraction effects cancel the fixed effect). Moreover, these individual differences in the attraction effect were negatively correlated with those in the spatial effect.\nThis comparison is of interest because a few years after the publication of Kliegl et al. (2011), the theoretically critical correlation parameter (CP) between the spatial effect and the attraction effect was determined as the source of a non-singular LMM in that paper. The present study served the purpose to estimate this parameter with a larger sample and a wider variety of experimental conditions.\nHere we also include two additional experimental manipulations of target size and orientation of cue rectangle. A similar analysis was reported in the parsimonious mixed-model paper (Bates et al., 2015); it was also used in a paper of GAMMs (Baayen et al., 2017). Data and R scripts of those analyses are also available in R-package RePsychLing.\nThe analysis is based on log-transformed reaction times lrt, indicated by a boxcox() check of model residuals.\nIn this vignette we focus on the reduction of model complexity. And we start with a quote:\n“Neither the [maximal] nor the [minimal] linear mixed models are appropriate for most repeated measures analysis. Using the [maximal] model is generally wasteful and costly in terms of statiscal power for testing hypotheses. On the other hand, the [minimal] model fails to account for nontrivial correlation among repeated measurements. This results in inflated [T]ype I error rates when non-negligible correlation does in fact exist. We can usually find middle ground, a covariance model that adequately accounts for correlation but is more parsimonious than the [maximal] model. Doing so allows us full control over [T]ype I error rates without needlessly sacrificing power.”\nStroup, W. W. (2012, p. 185).

The corresponding plot based on LMM m1_rt for raw reaction times still shows them with very wide distributions, but acceptable."

If there is no matching row in the second table then missing values are inserted for the columns from the right table in the result.\n\ndescribe(\n  leftjoin!(\n    ldttrial,\n    select(byitem, :item, :wrdlen, :isword);\n    on=:item,\n  ),\n)\n\n8×7 DataFrame\n\n\n\nRow\nvariable\nmean\nmin\nmedian\nmax\nnmissing\neltype\n\n\n\nSymbol\nUnion…\nAny\nUnion…\nAny\nInt64\nType\n\n\n\n\n1\nsubj\n409.31\n1\n409.0\n816\n0\nInt16\n\n\n2\nseq\n1687.21\n1\n1687.0\n3374\n0\nInt16\n\n\n3\nacc\n0.85604\nfalse\n1.0\ntrue\n1370\nUnion{Missing, Bool}\n\n\n4\nrt\n846.325\n-16160\n732.0\n32061\n0\nInt16\n\n\n5\nitem\n\nAarod\n\nzuss\n0\nString\n\n\n6\ns2\n0.407128\nfalse\n0.0\ntrue\n0\nBool\n\n\n7\nwrdlen\n7.99835\n1\n8.0\n21\n0\nUnion{Missing, Int8}\n\n\n8\nisword\n0.499995\nfalse\n0.0\ntrue\n0\nUnion{Missing, Bool}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the wrdlen and isword variables in this table allow for missing values, because they are derived from the second argument, but there are no missing values for these variables.

A plot of the median response time versus proportion accurate, Figure 3, shows that the subjects with lower accuracy are some of the fastest responders, further indicating that these subjects are sacrificing accuracy for speed.\n\n\nCode\ndraw(\n  data(bysubj) *\n  mapping(\n    :spropacc =&gt; \"Proportion accurate\",\n    :smedianrt =&gt; \"Median response time (ms)\",\n  ) *\n  (visual(Scatter) + smooth())\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Median response time versus proportion accurate by subject in the LDT.\n\n\n\n\nAs described in Balota et al. (2007), the participants performed the trials in blocks of 250 followed by a short break. During the break they were given feedback concerning accuracy and response latency in the previous block of trials. If the accuracy was less than 80% the participant was encouraged to improve their accuracy. Similarly, if the mean response latency was greater than 1000 ms, the participant was encouraged to decrease their response time. During the trials immediate feedback was given if the response was incorrect.\nNevertheless, approximately 15% of the subjects were unable to maintain 80% accuracy on their trials\n\ncount(&lt;(0.8), bysubj.spropacc) / nrow(bysubj)\n\n0.15233415233415235\n\n\nand there is some association of faster response times with low accuracy. The majority of the subjects whose median response time is less than 500 ms. are accurate on less than 75% of their trials. Another way of characterizing the relationship is that none of the subjects with 90% accuracy or greater had a median response time less than 500 ms.\n\nminimum(@subset(bysubj, :spropacc &gt; 0.9).smedianrt)\n\n505.0\n\n\nIt is common in analyses of response latency in a lexical discrimination task to consider only the latencies on correct identifications and to trim outliers. In Balota et al. (2007) a two-stage outlier removal strategy was used; first removing responses less than 200 ms or greater than 3000 ms then removing responses more than three standard deviations from the participant’s mean response.\nAs described in Section 1.2.3 we will analyze these data on a speed scale (the inverse of response time) using only the first-stage outlier removal of response latencies less than 200 ms or greater than 3000 ms. On the speed scale the limits are 0.333 per second up to 5 per second.\nTo examine the effects of the fast but inaccurate responders we will fit models to the data from all the participants and to the data from the 85% of participants who maintained an overall accuracy of 80% or greater.\n\npruned = @chain ldttrial begin\n  @subset(!ismissing(:acc), 200 ≤ :rt ≤ 3000,)\n  leftjoin!(select(bysubj, :subj, :spropacc); on=:subj)\n  dropmissing!\nend\nsize(pruned)\n\n(2714311, 9)\n\n\n\ndescribe(pruned)\n\n9×7 DataFrame\n\n\n\nRow\nvariable\nmean\nmin\nmedian\nmax\nnmissing\neltype\n\n\n\nSymbol\nUnion…\nAny\nUnion…\nAny\nInt64\nDataType\n\n\n\n\n1\nsubj\n409.802\n1\n410.0\n816\n0\nInt16\n\n\n2\nseq\n1684.56\n1\n1684.0\n3374\n0\nInt16\n\n\n3\nacc\n0.859884\nfalse\n1.0\ntrue\n0\nBool\n\n\n4\nrt\n838.712\n200\n733.0\n3000\n0\nInt16\n\n\n5\nitem\n\nAarod\n\nzuss\n0\nString\n\n\n6\ns2\n0.40663\nfalse\n0.0\ntrue\n0\nBool\n\n\n7\nwrdlen\n7.99244\n1\n8.0\n21\n0\nInt8\n\n\n8\nisword\n0.500126\nfalse\n1.0\ntrue\n0\nBool\n\n\n9\nspropacc\n0.857169\n0.511855\n0.869295\n0.973918\n0\nFloat64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Choice of response scale\nAs we have indicated, generally the response times are analyzed for the correct identifications only. Furthermore, unrealistically large or small response times are eliminated. For this example we only use the responses between 200 and 3000 ms.\nA density plot of the pruned response times, Figure 4, shows they are skewed to the right.\n\n\nCode\ndraw(\n  data(pruned) *\n  mapping(:rt =&gt; \"Response time (ms.) for correct responses\") *\n  AlgebraOfGraphics.density();\n  figure=(; resolution=(800, 450)),\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Kernel density plot of the pruned response times (ms.) in the LDT.\n\n\n\n\nIn such cases it is common to transform the response to a scale such as the logarithm of the response time or to the speed of the response, which is the inverse of the response time.\nThe density of the response speed, in responses per second, is shown in Figure 5.\n\n\nCode\ndraw(\n  data(pruned) *\n  mapping(\n    :rt =&gt; (x -&gt; 1000 / x) =&gt; \"Response speed (s⁻¹) for correct responses\") *\n  AlgebraOfGraphics.density();\n  figure=(; resolution=(800, 450)),\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Kernel density plot of the pruned response speed in the LDT.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 and Figure 5 indicate that it may be more reasonable to establish a lower bound of 1/3 second (333 ms) on the response latency, corresponding to an upper bound of 3 per second on the response speed. However, only about one half of one percent of the correct responses have latencies in the range of 200 ms. to 333 ms.\n\ncount(\n  r -&gt; !ismissing(r.acc) && 200 &lt; r.rt &lt; 333,\n  eachrow(ldttrial),\n) / count(!ismissing, ldttrial.acc)\n\n0.005867195806137328\n\n\nso the exact position of the lower cut-off point on the response latencies is unlikely to be very important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing inline transformations vs defining new columns\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you examine the code for (fit-elpldtspeeddens?), you will see that the conversion from rt to speed is done inline rather than creating and storing a new variable in the DataFrame.\nI prefer to keep the DataFrame simple with the integer variables (e.g. :rt) if possible.\nI recommend using the StandardizedPredictors.jl capabilities to center numeric variables or convert to zscores.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Transformation of response and the form of the model\nAs noted in Box & Cox (1964), a transformation of the response that produces a more Gaussian distribution often will also produce a simpler model structure. For example, Figure 6 shows the smoothed relationship between word length and response time for words and non-words separately,\n\n\nCode\ndraw(\n  data(pruned) *\n  mapping(\n    :wrdlen =&gt; \"Word length\",\n    :rt =&gt; \"Response time (ms)\";\n    :color =&gt; :isword,\n  ) * smooth()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Scatterplot smooths of response time versus word length in the LDT.\n\n\n\n\nand Figure 7 shows the similar relationships for speed\n\n\nCode\ndraw(\n  data(pruned) *\n  mapping(\n    :wrdlen =&gt; \"Word length\",\n    :rt =&gt; (x -&gt; 1000/x) =&gt; \"Speed of response (s⁻¹)\";\n    :color =&gt; :isword,\n  ) * smooth()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Scatterplot smooths of response speed versus word length in the LDT.\n\n\n\n\nFor the most part the smoother lines in Figure 7 are reasonably straight. The small amount of curvature is associated with short word lengths, say less than 4 characters, of which there are comparatively few in the study.\nFigure 8 shows a “violin plot” - the empirical density of the response speed by word length separately for words and nonwords. The lines on the plot are fit by linear regression.\n\n\nCode\nlet\n  plt = data(@subset(pruned, :wrdlen &gt; 3, :wrdlen &lt; 14))\n  plt *= mapping(\n    :wrdlen =&gt; \"Word length\",\n    :rt =&gt; (x -&gt; 1000/x) =&gt; \"Speed of response (s⁻¹)\",\n    color=:isword,\n    side=:isword,\n  )\n  plt *= visual(Violin)\n  draw(plt, axis=(; limits=(nothing, (0.0, 2.8))))\nend\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Empirical density of response speed versus word length by word/non-word status."

    "text": "1.3 Models with scalar random effects\nA major purpose of the English Lexicon Project is to characterize the items (words or nonwords) according to the observed accuracy of identification and to response latency, taking into account subject-to-subject variability, and to relate these to lexical characteristics of the items.\nIn Balota et al. (2007) the item response latency is characterized by the average response latency from the correct trials after outlier removal.\nMixed-effects models allow us greater flexibility and, we hope, precision in characterizing the items by controlling for subject-to-subject variability and for item characteristics such as word/nonword and item length.\nWe begin with a model that has scalar random effects for item and for subject and incorporates fixed-effects for word/nonword and for item length and for the interaction of these terms.\n\n1.3.1 Establish the contrasts\nBecause there are a large number of items in the data set it is important to assign a Grouping() contrast to item (and, less importantly, to subj). For the isword factor we will use an EffectsCoding contrast with the base level as false. The non-words are assigned -1 in this contrast and the words are assigned +1. The wrdlen covariate is on its original scale but centered at 8 characters.\nThus the (Intercept) coefficient is the predicted speed of response for a typical subject and typical item (without regard to word/non-word status) of 8 characters.\nSet these contrasts\n\ncontrasts = Dict(\n  :subj =&gt;

    "text": "Julius Krumbiegel also has a great blog post with more details on Julia environments.\nJulia packages can be configured (in a file called Project.toml) on a per-project basis. The packaged sources and compiled versions are stored in a central location, e.g. ~/.julia/packages and ~/.julia/compiled on Linux systems, but the configuration of packages to be used can be local to a project. The Pkg package is used to modify the local project’s configuration. (An alternative is “package mode” in the read-eval-print-loop or REPL, which we will show at the summer school.) Start julia in the directory of the cloned SMLP2023 repository\n\nusing Pkg        # there's a package called 'Pkg' to manipulate package configs\nPkg.activate(\".\")# activate the current directory as the project\n\nIf you’ve received an environment from someone/somewhere else – such as this course repository – then you’ll need to first “instantiate” it (i.e., install all the dependencies).\n\nPkg.instantiate()# only needed the first time you work in a project\nPkg.update()     # get the latest package versions compatible with the project\n\n\nPkg.status()\n\nOccasionally the Pkg.status function call will give info about new versions being available but blocked by requirements of other packages. This is to be expected - the package system is large and the web of dependencies are complex. Generally the Julia package system is very good at resolving dependencies.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

The Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) measures simple reaction time to a visual stimulus, presented approximately 10 times ⁄ minute (interstimulus interval varied from 2 to 10 s in 2-s increments) for 10 min and implemented in a thumb-operated, hand-held device (Dinges & Powell, 1985).\n\n\nThe study comprised 2 training days (T1, T2), one day with baseline measures (B), seven days with sleep deprivation (E1 to E7), and four recovery days (R1 to R4). T1 and T2 were devoted to training on the performance tests and familiarization with study procedures. PVT baseline testing commenced on the morning of the third day (B) and testing continued for the duration of the study (E1–E7, R1–R3; no measures were taken on R4). Bed times during T, B, and R days were 8 hours (23:00-07:00).\n\n\n\nThe PVT (along with the Stanford Sleepiness Scale) was administered as a battery four times per day (09:00, 12:00, 15:00, and 21:00 h); the battery included other tests not reported here (see Balkin et al., 2000). The sleep latency test was administered at 09:40 and 15:30 h for all groups. Subjects in the 3- and 5-h TIB groups performed an additional battery at 00:00 h and 02:00 h to occupy their additional time awake. The PVT and SSS were administered in this battery; however, as data from the 00:00 and 02:00 h sessions were not common to all TIB groups, these data were not included in the statistical analyses reported in the paper.\n\n\n\nThe authors analyzed response speed, that is (1/RT)*1000 – completely warranted according to a Box-Cox check of the current data – with mixed-model ANOVAs using group as between- and day as within-subject factors. The ANOVA was followed up with simple tests of the design effects implemented over days for each of the four groups.\n\n\n\nThe current data distributed with the RData collection is attributed to the 3-hour TIB group, but the means do not agree at all with those reported for this group in (Belenky et al., 2003, fig. 3) where the 3-hour TIB group is also based on only 13 (not 18) subjects. Specifically, the current data show a much smaller slow-down of response speed across E1 to E7 and do not reflect the recovery during R1 to R3. The current data also cover only 10 not 11 days, but it looks like only R3 is missing. The closest match of the current means was with the average of the 3-hour and 7-hour TIB groups; if only males were included, this would amount to 18 subjects. (This conjecture is based only on visual inspection of graphs.)"
